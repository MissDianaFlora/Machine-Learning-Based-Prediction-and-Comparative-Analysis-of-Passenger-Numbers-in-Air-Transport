Experiences using Public transport in Ireland,"I’ve seen a lot of posts on this Reddit about how public transport in Ireland is terrible and not worth considering when travelling around the country. Sure there are gaps in coverage and now and again the bus in particular just randomly doesn’t turn up or is already full or late ( mainly because the operators are having difficulties recruiting).

Thought I’d start a thread here where locals and visitors could share their experiences. I have used intercity Irish rail, Dublin Bus , Luas and Dart extensively but have only limited experience using Bus Eireann. 

Overall,  it’s not terrible in my experience, far from it. 

Irish rail is great value and reasonably priced for long distance travel. Transport in Dublin is fine- the 90 minute fixed fare is super though obviously what we have doesn’t compare to larger cities like London in the reach and frequency. As a result the city can be congested though it impacts on all modes of transport especially buses and cars, the impact is less so on Luas and not at all on the dart.
You can make a reasonable argument that the buses and trains should have a lot more coverage and greater frequency but for the rail network what is there works really well, is fast, comfortable and for longer journeys is excellent value. As a for instance, the  train from Dublin to Galway booked online is €15 on a very comfortable train with a free seat reservation included. I think that’s good value for a c. 200km, 2.5 hour journey and compares well to other countries. I’ve paid far more in the UK for similar journeys. The petrol and motorway tolls to do that drive would cost you significantly more even driving a car you already own never mind having to hire one.

Among local users the satisfaction surveys are pretty good- see here https://www.transportforireland.ie/news/nta-publishes-results-of-customer-satisfaction-survey/

And stats around reliability https://www.irishrail.ie/en-ie/about-us/train-punctuality-reliability-performance

Can we get a more balanced and objective view to help visitors out?

Edit: There is some great real world feedback below- consensus I think that Irish rail is grand, if sometimes crowded and getting around Dublin by public transport is also pretty ok (with the acknowledged lunacy that you can’t reach the Airport other than by bus or taxi) but a lot of frustration with rural and intercity buses which are unreliable. Driving in Dublin generally won’t make much sense to those unfamiliar with the city, it’s fairly congested, parking is expensive and you’ll find it easier to get around the city centre where most of the sites are on foot, cycling or using public transport than trying to drive.

There is also a view that getting to key (scenic) tourist destinations outside the cities like the Cliffs of Moher and Ring of Kerry using public transport is much more problematic- it’s doable but relies on buses and can be slow which may not suit visitors whose time in Ireland may be constrained. A specialist day trip tour will likely suit your needs better. 

Suggestion: 

What would improve the rail system would be making easier to travel between regional cities, too much of the tracks radiate from
Dublin and it’s a palaver with multiple changes to get (say) from Killarney to Galway.

Given Irish rail operate extremely expensive tourist rail tours there may also be an argument for more focus on scheduled tourist oriented routes and expanding the bus network around tourist locations. 
As someone once said, build it and they will come.

Long distance trains

Buy and and plan intercity train journeys on https://www.irishrail.ie/en-ie/. Best prices available online and fares are the same price at all times, varying slightly for the amount of flexibility you want usually ok to buy a day or so in advance but may be booked out at very busy times. Some routes can be busy so reserve seat in advance when booking online.

You get a code back by email and then collect your ticket in the machine in the station. You can opt to display your name or a reservation number over the seat in the carriage which will indicate its taken (not always observed but people will usually move when asked- generally Irish people are polite travellers but occasionally can be a bit raucous when in large groups say travelling to a stag do or a sporting occasion). You are not permitted to consume alcohol on board by the way.

But city to city train travel is usually cheaper, handier than driving and you’ll see more on the train. Driving and train times are usually comparable on motorway routes and the train can edge it on routes like Killarney where there’s a decent non motorway leg after Limerick. However, bear in mind the car gets you door to door where you may have local travel to book end your train journey which can slow you down.

Travelling around Dublin.

Arrival in Dublin by Air

Dublin Airport bizarrely is not served by train. Options are taxis (plan on €30 fare depending on traffic to City centre and time of travel) or express coaches. Obviously a taxi may work
out cost effective for a group of 4.

If you’re on a tight budget Dublin airport is also served by local buses 41 and 16 which are pretty regular (41 runs 24 hours) if you buy a regular leap card (see below) in the airport before you leave it’s a €2 fare into the city centre, slightly more if paying cash and no change given of notes or credit/ debit cards accepted as of now (work
underway on this but it’s at least a year away). 

However 16/41 are not a tourist bus and therefore luggage space will be limited so if you’re hawking a large 20kg suitcase an
express bus will better serve your needs.

There are also a range of long distance coaches serving other regional cities from the airport, some
direct and bypassing Dublin City.

See https://www.dublinairport.com/to-from-the-airport/by-bus

Getting around Dublin

Dublin has three modes of public transport (all accept leap cards) as well as the Dublin Bike scheme which is very popular but limited to the inner city area.

There are also specialist tourist oriented city tour buses which allow you to hop on/off and have guide commentary. Heavily promoted in the city centre ( say on Dame Street in front of Trinity) and it’s unlikely you won’t see them.

Walking tours are also very popular- look on trip advisor for the highest rated ones- usually provided by knowledgeable and humorous local guides.

Ticketing in Dublin public transport

It’s not necessary/ possible to buy commuter bus, tram or local train journeys in advance. All can be crowded during rush commuter hour but you’ll still get on (usually) though you might need to stand. As in any city at busy times pay attention to your luggage and be vigilant for pickpockets which are not unknown.

Buy bus tickets from the driver (you can pay with coins or notes but you won’t get change), you can pay for Luas or train tickets which are sold in machines at each Luas stop or train station. You can pay for Luas and train tickets using credit or debit cards but buses are cash only or tag on instead of buying a ticket using your leap card -

See below section on leap cards (both commuter and visitor )  for a convenient and low hassle approach to paying fares below. 

City buses - generally ok but not super easy to figure out the routes/ stops- use the TFI route planner or see https://www.dublinbus.ie/home.
Frequency is less good outside of peak times and the buses themselves are a mixture of new and old buses with some fairly shabby vehicles still in service (but bear in mind most journeys are short and they work ok as a means of getting to the many places not covered by Luas and Dart.

Tram is called the Luas and has two lines both of which traverse the city centre. Green line goes from Broombridge in Cabra on the Northside to Brides Glen in the south suburbs. 

The red line goes from the 3arena in the docklands to Saggart and Tallaght in the south west suburbs. 

Off the top of my head I can’t think of much tourist destinations on the Green line but the red line serves the National
Museum, Heuston (main intercity train station) as well as Kilmainham gaol. Guinness Storehouse/ brewery isn’t too far from Heuston stop either.

See map https://luas.ie/assets/files/Luas_Map.pdf

Commuter trains in Dublin are the Dart (running along Dublin Bay coast from
Malahide and Howth in the North to Bray and Greystones in the south and the southern part is a very picturesque trip along an historic railway line https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin_and_Kingstown_Railway?wprov=sfti1) and Arrow serving commuter suburbs to the west of the city.

Dublin BIke Scheme

These are literally everywhere in the city centre and there are plenty of bikes available across the network of bike stations 

1 day pass costs €3.50, €5 for
3 days 

They’ve added these short passes to the mobile app way of unlocking a bike which is the handiest
Once you’ve bought a pass most journeys are free (you only pay for journeys lasting more than 30 mins and Dublin is pretty compact and flat) see https://www.dublinbikes.ie/en/home

Student/Young person travel 

International students (as well as locals) studying full time can apply for a student leap card https://about.leapcard.ie/young-adult-and-student-card-launch which gives a 50% discount on travel. A similar young adult card (no requirement to be a full time student) isavailable also and soon to be extended (early 2024) to those aged 19 to 25. Discounts for student/YA cards apply to all fares nationwide not just those in the Dublin leap card ( commuter/ short hop) zone.

Leap Travel cards
There is a visitor leap card available which gives unlimited travel in the Dublin region at fixed prices

1 day (24 hours) – €8.00
3 days (72 hours) – €16.00
7 days (168 hours) – €32.00

These prices are less than the daily caps for regular leap cards so if you’re doing a lot of journeys they work out good value and you don’t have to worry about running out of credit. 

A regular (non visitor)  leap card costs €5 and it makes most sense if you’re only taking a few journeys which will be the case for many visitors as Dublin is compact enough to explore the city centre on foot.  if you’re spending a few days in Dublin the regular card may work out cheaper than a visitor card for light use. Leap card credit can be topped up in rail stations or using mobile app. 

Main advantages of leap cards are not having to worry about coins on buses which dont take credit cards and don’t give change of notes, flat €2 fare for 90 minute unlimited travel across multiple modes of transport and
discounts on the cash fare.  

Both types of regular/ visitor leap cards can be bought in the ticket machines in train stations and many retail agents https://about.leapcard.ie/about/where-to-buy

But you need to visit a specialist Student Leap agent to buy a student or young adult card as these require you to prove eligibility and have a photo taken.","Bus eireann extremely unreliable Allow a lot of extra time if you need to be on time and avoid for intercounty travel (very slow). Private buses to and from Dublin oversubscribed (Aircoach, Gobus, etc.) and need to be booked in advance. Expressway really overpriced. 

Luas, Dublin Bus, Dart and Irishrail are decent. Irishrail and Dart are a bit outdated"

It would be nice if they could at least announce bus route cancellations or delays so people could have the chance to make alternative plans rather than waiting for a bus that’s not due to show up for another hour or two.

A regular (non visitor)  leap card costs €5 and it makes most sense if you’re only taking a few journeys which will be the case for many visitors as Dublin is compact enough to explore the city centre on foot.  if you’re spending a few days in Dublin the regular card may work out cheaper than a visitor card for light use. Leap card credit can be topped up in rail stations or using mobile app. 

Main advantages of leap cards are not having to worry about coins on buses which dont take credit cards and don’t give change of notes, flat €2 fare for 90 minute unlimited travel across multiple modes of transport and
discounts on the cash fare.  

Both types of regular/ visitor leap cards can be bought in the ticket machines in train stations and many retail agents https://about.leapcard.ie/about/where-to-buy

But you need to visit a specialist Student Leap agent to buy a student or young adult card as these require you to prove eligibility and have a photo taken.","Last year I was supposed to get a car service pickup from Dublin Airport to Donegal Town.   The company, Blacklane, bailed on me, sending me a message while I was sitting in the airport.  Fortuantely I remembered that there was a bus that would take me to Donegal town though it took forever to find someone who knew about it.  Once  I got on it for about 20 Euros it was perfectly pleasant.  I took the same bus to Donegal Town again this year.   I've also taken the Feda Bus from Donegal to Galway which is a nice ride.  I've taken the train between Dublin and Galway and Dublin and Killarney and all of these had nice scenery to view on the way.  

I was also able to get around Donegal, which has no rail service, by using a local bus.  I traveled twice to Glencolmcille to take photographs which worked out very well.  

My other favorite place to travel is Newfoundland, and I only wish they had the kind of public transportation that even Donegal has."
Experiences using Public transport in Ireland,"I’ve seen a lot of posts on this Reddit about how public transport in Ireland is terrible and not worth considering when travelling around the country. Sure there are gaps in coverage and now and again the bus in particular just randomly doesn’t turn up or is already full or late ( mainly because the operators are having difficulties recruiting).

Thought I’d start a thread here where locals and visitors could share their experiences. I have used intercity Irish rail, Dublin Bus , Luas and Dart extensively but have only limited experience using Bus Eireann. 

Overall,  it’s not terrible in my experience, far from it. 

Irish rail is great value and reasonably priced for long distance travel. Transport in Dublin is fine- the 90 minute fixed fare is super though obviously what we have doesn’t compare to larger cities like London in the reach and frequency. As a result the city can be congested though it impacts on all modes of transport especially buses and cars, the impact is less so on Luas and not at all on the dart.
You can make a reasonable argument that the buses and trains should have a lot more coverage and greater frequency but for the rail network what is there works really well, is fast, comfortable and for longer journeys is excellent value. As a for instance, the  train from Dublin to Galway booked online is €15 on a very comfortable train with a free seat reservation included. I think that’s good value for a c. 200km, 2.5 hour journey and compares well to other countries. I’ve paid far more in the UK for similar journeys. The petrol and motorway tolls to do that drive would cost you significantly more even driving a car you already own never mind having to hire one.

Among local users the satisfaction surveys are pretty good- see here https://www.transportforireland.ie/news/nta-publishes-results-of-customer-satisfaction-survey/

And stats around reliability https://www.irishrail.ie/en-ie/about-us/train-punctuality-reliability-performance

Can we get a more balanced and objective view to help visitors out?

Edit: There is some great real world feedback below- consensus I think that Irish rail is grand, if sometimes crowded and getting around Dublin by public transport is also pretty ok (with the acknowledged lunacy that you can’t reach the Airport other than by bus or taxi) but a lot of frustration with rural and intercity buses which are unreliable. Driving in Dublin generally won’t make much sense to those unfamiliar with the city, it’s fairly congested, parking is expensive and you’ll find it easier to get around the city centre where most of the sites are on foot, cycling or using public transport than trying to drive.

There is also a view that getting to key (scenic) tourist destinations outside the cities like the Cliffs of Moher and Ring of Kerry using public transport is much more problematic- it’s doable but relies on buses and can be slow which may not suit visitors whose time in Ireland may be constrained. A specialist day trip tour will likely suit your needs better. 

Suggestion: 

What would improve the rail system would be making easier to travel between regional cities, too much of the tracks radiate from
Dublin and it’s a palaver with multiple changes to get (say) from Killarney to Galway.

Given Irish rail operate extremely expensive tourist rail tours there may also be an argument for more focus on scheduled tourist oriented routes and expanding the bus network around tourist locations. 
As someone once said, build it and they will come.

Long distance trains

Buy and and plan intercity train journeys on https://www.irishrail.ie/en-ie/. Best prices available online and fares are the same price at all times, varying slightly for the amount of flexibility you want usually ok to buy a day or so in advance but may be booked out at very busy times. Some routes can be busy so reserve seat in advance when booking online.

You get a code back by email and then collect your ticket in the machine in the station. You can opt to display your name or a reservation number over the seat in the carriage which will indicate its taken (not always observed but people will usually move when asked- generally Irish people are polite travellers but occasionally can be a bit raucous when in large groups say travelling to a stag do or a sporting occasion). You are not permitted to consume alcohol on board by the way.

But city to city train travel is usually cheaper, handier than driving and you’ll see more on the train. Driving and train times are usually comparable on motorway routes and the train can edge it on routes like Killarney where there’s a decent non motorway leg after Limerick. However, bear in mind the car gets you door to door where you may have local travel to book end your train journey which can slow you down.

Travelling around Dublin.

Arrival in Dublin by Air

Dublin Airport bizarrely is not served by train. Options are taxis (plan on €30 fare depending on traffic to City centre and time of travel) or express coaches. Obviously a taxi may work
out cost effective for a group of 4.

If you’re on a tight budget Dublin airport is also served by local buses 41 and 16 which are pretty regular (41 runs 24 hours) if you buy a regular leap card (see below) in the airport before you leave it’s a €2 fare into the city centre, slightly more if paying cash and no change given of notes or credit/ debit cards accepted as of now (work
underway on this but it’s at least a year away). 

However 16/41 are not a tourist bus and therefore luggage space will be limited so if you’re hawking a large 20kg suitcase an
express bus will better serve your needs.

There are also a range of long distance coaches serving other regional cities from the airport, some
direct and bypassing Dublin City.

See https://www.dublinairport.com/to-from-the-airport/by-bus

Getting around Dublin

Dublin has three modes of public transport (all accept leap cards) as well as the Dublin Bike scheme which is very popular but limited to the inner city area.

There are also specialist tourist oriented city tour buses which allow you to hop on/off and have guide commentary. Heavily promoted in the city centre ( say on Dame Street in front of Trinity) and it’s unlikely you won’t see them.

Walking tours are also very popular- look on trip advisor for the highest rated ones- usually provided by knowledgeable and humorous local guides.

Ticketing in Dublin public transport

It’s not necessary/ possible to buy commuter bus, tram or local train journeys in advance. All can be crowded during rush commuter hour but you’ll still get on (usually) though you might need to stand. As in any city at busy times pay attention to your luggage and be vigilant for pickpockets which are not unknown.

Buy bus tickets from the driver (you can pay with coins or notes but you won’t get change), you can pay for Luas or train tickets which are sold in machines at each Luas stop or train station. You can pay for Luas and train tickets using credit or debit cards but buses are cash only or tag on instead of buying a ticket using your leap card -

See below section on leap cards (both commuter and visitor )  for a convenient and low hassle approach to paying fares below. 

City buses - generally ok but not super easy to figure out the routes/ stops- use the TFI route planner or see https://www.dublinbus.ie/home.
Frequency is less good outside of peak times and the buses themselves are a mixture of new and old buses with some fairly shabby vehicles still in service (but bear in mind most journeys are short and they work ok as a means of getting to the many places not covered by Luas and Dart.

Tram is called the Luas and has two lines both of which traverse the city centre. Green line goes from Broombridge in Cabra on the Northside to Brides Glen in the south suburbs. 

The red line goes from the 3arena in the docklands to Saggart and Tallaght in the south west suburbs. 

Off the top of my head I can’t think of much tourist destinations on the Green line but the red line serves the National
Museum, Heuston (main intercity train station) as well as Kilmainham gaol. Guinness Storehouse/ brewery isn’t too far from Heuston stop either.

See map https://luas.ie/assets/files/Luas_Map.pdf

Commuter trains in Dublin are the Dart (running along Dublin Bay coast from
Malahide and Howth in the North to Bray and Greystones in the south and the southern part is a very picturesque trip along an historic railway line https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin_and_Kingstown_Railway?wprov=sfti1) and Arrow serving commuter suburbs to the west of the city.

Dublin BIke Scheme

These are literally everywhere in the city centre and there are plenty of bikes available across the network of bike stations 

1 day pass costs €3.50, €5 for
3 days 

They’ve added these short passes to the mobile app way of unlocking a bike which is the handiest
Once you’ve bought a pass most journeys are free (you only pay for journeys lasting more than 30 mins and Dublin is pretty compact and flat) see https://www.dublinbikes.ie/en/home

Student/Young person travel 

International students (as well as locals) studying full time can apply for a student leap card https://about.leapcard.ie/young-adult-and-student-card-launch which gives a 50% discount on travel. A similar young adult card (no requirement to be a full time student) isavailable also and soon to be extended (early 2024) to those aged 19 to 25. Discounts for student/YA cards apply to all fares nationwide not just those in the Dublin leap card ( commuter/ short hop) zone.

Leap Travel cards
There is a visitor leap card available which gives unlimited travel in the Dublin region at fixed prices

1 day (24 hours) – €8.00
3 days (72 hours) – €16.00
7 days (168 hours) – €32.00

These prices are less than the daily caps for regular leap cards so if you’re doing a lot of journeys they work out good value and you don’t have to worry about running out of credit.

I've visited Cork, Sligo, Newry, Dublin, and Glendalough and have plans to visit Galway, Mayo, and Kerry over the next month before I leave, and it's all been via public transport. 

Overall, I find that Irish public transport is poor by European standards but much, much better than what I'm used to back home in Texas. If you're coming to Ireland with a particularly rural itinerary a car is a fine idea but it's by no means a requirement if you just want to see the major cities and tourist spots.

Off the top of my head I can’t think of much tourist destinations on the Green line but the red line serves the National
Museum, Heuston (main intercity train station) as well as Kilmainham gaol. Guinness Storehouse/ brewery isn’t too far from Heuston stop either.

Commuter trains in Dublin are the Dart (running along Dublin Bay coast from
Malahide and Howth in the North to Bray and Greystones in the south and the southern part is a very picturesque trip along an historic railway line https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin_and_Kingstown_Railway?wprov=sfti1) and Arrow serving commuter suburbs to the west of the city.

Dublin BIke Scheme

These are literally everywhere in the city centre and there are plenty of bikes available across the network of bike stations 

1 day pass costs €3.50, €5 for
3 days 

They’ve added these short passes to the mobile app way of unlocking a bike which is the handiest
Once you’ve bought a pass most journeys are free (you only pay for journeys lasting more than 30 mins and Dublin is pretty compact and flat) see https://www.dublinbikes.ie/en/home

Student/Young person travel 

International students (as well as locals) studying full time can apply for a student leap card https://about.leapcard.ie/young-adult-and-student-card-launch which gives a 50% discount on travel. A similar young adult card (no requirement to be a full time student) isavailable also and soon to be extended (early 2024) to those aged 19 to 25. Discounts for student/YA cards apply to all fares nationwide not just those in the Dublin leap card ( commuter/ short hop) zone.

Leap Travel cards
There is a visitor leap card available which gives unlimited travel in the Dublin region at fixed prices

1 day (24 hours) – €8.00
3 days (72 hours) – €16.00
7 days (168 hours) – €32.00

These prices are less than the daily caps for regular leap cards so if you’re doing a lot of journeys they work out good value and you don’t have to worry about running out of credit. 

A regular (non visitor)  leap card costs €5 and it makes most sense if you’re only taking a few journeys which will be the case for many visitors as Dublin is compact enough to explore the city centre on foot.  if you’re spending a few days in Dublin the regular card may work out cheaper than a visitor card for light use. Leap card credit can be topped up in rail stations or using mobile app. 

Main advantages of leap cards are not having to worry about coins on buses which dont take credit cards and don’t give change of notes, flat €2 fare for 90 minute unlimited travel across multiple modes of transport and
discounts on the cash fare.  

Both types of regular/ visitor leap cards can be bought in the ticket machines in train stations and many retail agents https://about.leapcard.ie/about/where-to-buy

But you need to visit a specialist Student Leap agent to buy a student or young adult card as these require you to prove eligibility and have a photo taken.",I had nothing but good experiences with the one exception of getting to and from the airport in Dublin. Also it's kind of weird that the airport in Kerry was built kind of far from the nearest rail station.
Experiences using Public transport in Ireland,"I’ve seen a lot of posts on this Reddit about how public transport in Ireland is terrible and not worth considering when travelling around the country. Sure there are gaps in coverage and now and again the bus in particular just randomly doesn’t turn up or is already full or late ( mainly because the operators are having difficulties recruiting).

Thought I’d start a thread here where locals and visitors could share their experiences. I have used intercity Irish rail, Dublin Bus , Luas and Dart extensively but have only limited experience using Bus Eireann. 

Overall,  it’s not terrible in my experience, far from it. 

Irish rail is great value and reasonably priced for long distance travel. Transport in Dublin is fine- the 90 minute fixed fare is super though obviously what we have doesn’t compare to larger cities like London in the reach and frequency. As a result the city can be congested though it impacts on all modes of transport especially buses and cars, the impact is less so on Luas and not at all on the dart.
You can make a reasonable argument that the buses and trains should have a lot more coverage and greater frequency but for the rail network what is there works really well, is fast, comfortable and for longer journeys is excellent value. As a for instance, the  train from Dublin to Galway booked online is €15 on a very comfortable train with a free seat reservation included. I think that’s good value for a c. 200km, 2.5 hour journey and compares well to other countries. I’ve paid far more in the UK for similar journeys. The petrol and motorway tolls to do that drive would cost you significantly more even driving a car you already own never mind having to hire one.

Among local users the satisfaction surveys are pretty good- see here https://www.transportforireland.ie/news/nta-publishes-results-of-customer-satisfaction-survey/

And stats around reliability https://www.irishrail.ie/en-ie/about-us/train-punctuality-reliability-performance

Can we get a more balanced and objective view to help visitors out?

Edit: There is some great real world feedback below- consensus I think that Irish rail is grand, if sometimes crowded and getting around Dublin by public transport is also pretty ok (with the acknowledged lunacy that you can’t reach the Airport other than by bus or taxi) but a lot of frustration with rural and intercity buses which are unreliable. Driving in Dublin generally won’t make much sense to those unfamiliar with the city, it’s fairly congested, parking is expensive and you’ll find it easier to get around the city centre where most of the sites are on foot, cycling or using public transport than trying to drive.

There is also a view that getting to key (scenic) tourist destinations outside the cities like the Cliffs of Moher and Ring of Kerry using public transport is much more problematic- it’s doable but relies on buses and can be slow which may not suit visitors whose time in Ireland may be constrained. A specialist day trip tour will likely suit your needs better. 

Suggestion: 

What would improve the rail system would be making easier to travel between regional cities, too much of the tracks radiate from
Dublin and it’s a palaver with multiple changes to get (say) from Killarney to Galway.

Given Irish rail operate extremely expensive tourist rail tours there may also be an argument for more focus on scheduled tourist oriented routes and expanding the bus network around tourist locations. 
As someone once said, build it and they will come.

Long distance trains

Buy and and plan intercity train journeys on https://www.irishrail.ie/en-ie/. Best prices available online and fares are the same price at all times, varying slightly for the amount of flexibility you want usually ok to buy a day or so in advance but may be booked out at very busy times. Some routes can be busy so reserve seat in advance when booking online.

You get a code back by email and then collect your ticket in the machine in the station. You can opt to display your name or a reservation number over the seat in the carriage which will indicate its taken (not always observed but people will usually move when asked- generally Irish people are polite travellers but occasionally can be a bit raucous when in large groups say travelling to a stag do or a sporting occasion). You are not permitted to consume alcohol on board by the way.

But city to city train travel is usually cheaper, handier than driving and you’ll see more on the train. Driving and train times are usually comparable on motorway routes and the train can edge it on routes like Killarney where there’s a decent non motorway leg after Limerick. However, bear in mind the car gets you door to door where you may have local travel to book end your train journey which can slow you down.

Travelling around Dublin.

Arrival in Dublin by Air

Dublin Airport bizarrely is not served by train. Options are taxis (plan on €30 fare depending on traffic to City centre and time of travel) or express coaches. Obviously a taxi may work
out cost effective for a group of 4.

If you’re on a tight budget Dublin airport is also served by local buses 41 and 16 which are pretty regular (41 runs 24 hours) if you buy a regular leap card (see below) in the airport before you leave it’s a €2 fare into the city centre, slightly more if paying cash and no change given of notes or credit/ debit cards accepted as of now (work
underway on this but it’s at least a year away). 

However 16/41 are not a tourist bus and therefore luggage space will be limited so if you’re hawking a large 20kg suitcase an
express bus will better serve your needs.

There are also a range of long distance coaches serving other regional cities from the airport, some
direct and bypassing Dublin City.

See https://www.dublinairport.com/to-from-the-airport/by-bus

Getting around Dublin

Dublin has three modes of public transport (all accept leap cards) as well as the Dublin Bike scheme which is very popular but limited to the inner city area.

There are also specialist tourist oriented city tour buses which allow you to hop on/off and have guide commentary. Heavily promoted in the city centre ( say on Dame Street in front of Trinity) and it’s unlikely you won’t see them.

Walking tours are also very popular- look on trip advisor for the highest rated ones- usually provided by knowledgeable and humorous local guides.

Ticketing in Dublin public transport

It’s not necessary/ possible to buy commuter bus, tram or local train journeys in advance. All can be crowded during rush commuter hour but you’ll still get on (usually) though you might need to stand. As in any city at busy times pay attention to your luggage and be vigilant for pickpockets which are not unknown.

Buy bus tickets from the driver (you can pay with coins or notes but you won’t get change), you can pay for Luas or train tickets which are sold in machines at each Luas stop or train station. You can pay for Luas and train tickets using credit or debit cards but buses are cash only or tag on instead of buying a ticket using your leap card -

See below section on leap cards (both commuter and visitor )  for a convenient and low hassle approach to paying fares below. 

City buses - generally ok but not super easy to figure out the routes/ stops- use the TFI route planner or see https://www.dublinbus.ie/home.
Frequency is less good outside of peak times and the buses themselves are a mixture of new and old buses with some fairly shabby vehicles still in service (but bear in mind most journeys are short and they work ok as a means of getting to the many places not covered by Luas and Dart.

Tram is called the Luas and has two lines both of which traverse the city centre. Green line goes from Broombridge in Cabra on the Northside to Brides Glen in the south suburbs. 

The red line goes from the 3arena in the docklands to Saggart and Tallaght in the south west suburbs.

Buy bus tickets from the driver (you can pay with coins or notes but you won’t get change), you can pay for Luas or train tickets which are sold in machines at each Luas stop or train station. You can pay for Luas and train tickets using credit or debit cards but buses are cash only or tag on instead of buying a ticket using your leap card -

See below section on leap cards (both commuter and visitor )  for a convenient and low hassle approach to paying fares below. 

City buses - generally ok but not super easy to figure out the routes/ stops- use the TFI route planner or see https://www.dublinbus.ie/home.
Frequency is less good outside of peak times and the buses themselves are a mixture of new and old buses with some fairly shabby vehicles still in service (but bear in mind most journeys are short and they work ok as a means of getting to the many places not covered by Luas and Dart.

Tram is called the Luas and has two lines both of which traverse the city centre. Green line goes from Broombridge in Cabra on the Northside to Brides Glen in the south suburbs. 

The red line goes from the 3arena in the docklands to Saggart and Tallaght in the south west suburbs. 

Off the top of my head I can’t think of much tourist destinations on the Green line but the red line serves the National
Museum, Heuston (main intercity train station) as well as Kilmainham gaol. Guinness Storehouse/ brewery isn’t too far from Heuston stop either.

Commuter trains in Dublin are the Dart (running along Dublin Bay coast from
Malahide and Howth in the North to Bray and Greystones in the south and the southern part is a very picturesque trip along an historic railway line https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin_and_Kingstown_Railway?wprov=sfti1) and Arrow serving commuter suburbs to the west of the city.

Dublin BIke Scheme

These are literally everywhere in the city centre and there are plenty of bikes available across the network of bike stations 

1 day pass costs €3.50, €5 for
3 days 

They’ve added these short passes to the mobile app way of unlocking a bike which is the handiest
Once you’ve bought a pass most journeys are free (you only pay for journeys lasting more than 30 mins and Dublin is pretty compact and flat) see https://www.dublinbikes.ie/en/home

Student/Young person travel 

International students (as well as locals) studying full time can apply for a student leap card https://about.leapcard.ie/young-adult-and-student-card-launch which gives a 50% discount on travel. A similar young adult card (no requirement to be a full time student) isavailable also and soon to be extended (early 2024) to those aged 19 to 25. Discounts for student/YA cards apply to all fares nationwide not just those in the Dublin leap card ( commuter/ short hop) zone.

Leap Travel cards
There is a visitor leap card available which gives unlimited travel in the Dublin region at fixed prices

1 day (24 hours) – €8.00
3 days (72 hours) – €16.00
7 days (168 hours) – €32.00

These prices are less than the daily caps for regular leap cards so if you’re doing a lot of journeys they work out good value and you don’t have to worry about running out of credit. 

A regular (non visitor)  leap card costs €5 and it makes most sense if you’re only taking a few journeys which will be the case for many visitors as Dublin is compact enough to explore the city centre on foot.  if you’re spending a few days in Dublin the regular card may work out cheaper than a visitor card for light use. Leap card credit can be topped up in rail stations or using mobile app. 

Main advantages of leap cards are not having to worry about coins on buses which dont take credit cards and don’t give change of notes, flat €2 fare for 90 minute unlimited travel across multiple modes of transport and
discounts on the cash fare.  

Both types of regular/ visitor leap cards can be bought in the ticket machines in train stations and many retail agents https://about.leapcard.ie/about/where-to-buy

But you need to visit a specialist Student Leap agent to buy a student or young adult card as these require you to prove eligibility and have a photo taken.","Yesterday I was at Spencer Dock luas Station. You can see the final stop (the point) from this station.  The board  said emxt luas in 11 mins then after 11 minutes passed went back up to 8 mins. Then after the 8 mins passed sat at due for another 12 minutes (I was timing it at this stage).

The whole time a luas was sitting at that final stop but never moved and what's more it was joined by another TWO there afterwards.

Sums up public transport in my book"
Experiences using Public transport in Ireland,"I’ve seen a lot of posts on this Reddit about how public transport in Ireland is terrible and not worth considering when travelling around the country. Sure there are gaps in coverage and now and again the bus in particular just randomly doesn’t turn up or is already full or late ( mainly because the operators are having difficulties recruiting).

Thought I’d start a thread here where locals and visitors could share their experiences. I have used intercity Irish rail, Dublin Bus , Luas and Dart extensively but have only limited experience using Bus Eireann. 

Overall,  it’s not terrible in my experience, far from it. 

Irish rail is great value and reasonably priced for long distance travel. Transport in Dublin is fine- the 90 minute fixed fare is super though obviously what we have doesn’t compare to larger cities like London in the reach and frequency. As a result the city can be congested though it impacts on all modes of transport especially buses and cars, the impact is less so on Luas and not at all on the dart.
You can make a reasonable argument that the buses and trains should have a lot more coverage and greater frequency but for the rail network what is there works really well, is fast, comfortable and for longer journeys is excellent value. As a for instance, the  train from Dublin to Galway booked online is €15 on a very comfortable train with a free seat reservation included. I think that’s good value for a c. 200km, 2.5 hour journey and compares well to other countries. I’ve paid far more in the UK for similar journeys. The petrol and motorway tolls to do that drive would cost you significantly more even driving a car you already own never mind having to hire one.

Among local users the satisfaction surveys are pretty good- see here https://www.transportforireland.ie/news/nta-publishes-results-of-customer-satisfaction-survey/

And stats around reliability https://www.irishrail.ie/en-ie/about-us/train-punctuality-reliability-performance

Can we get a more balanced and objective view to help visitors out?

Edit: There is some great real world feedback below- consensus I think that Irish rail is grand, if sometimes crowded and getting around Dublin by public transport is also pretty ok (with the acknowledged lunacy that you can’t reach the Airport other than by bus or taxi) but a lot of frustration with rural and intercity buses which are unreliable. Driving in Dublin generally won’t make much sense to those unfamiliar with the city, it’s fairly congested, parking is expensive and you’ll find it easier to get around the city centre where most of the sites are on foot, cycling or using public transport than trying to drive.

There is also a view that getting to key (scenic) tourist destinations outside the cities like the Cliffs of Moher and Ring of Kerry using public transport is much more problematic- it’s doable but relies on buses and can be slow which may not suit visitors whose time in Ireland may be constrained. A specialist day trip tour will likely suit your needs better. 

Suggestion: 

What would improve the rail system would be making easier to travel between regional cities, too much of the tracks radiate from
Dublin and it’s a palaver with multiple changes to get (say) from Killarney to Galway.

Given Irish rail operate extremely expensive tourist rail tours there may also be an argument for more focus on scheduled tourist oriented routes and expanding the bus network around tourist locations. 
As someone once said, build it and they will come.

Long distance trains

Buy and and plan intercity train journeys on https://www.irishrail.ie/en-ie/. Best prices available online and fares are the same price at all times, varying slightly for the amount of flexibility you want usually ok to buy a day or so in advance but may be booked out at very busy times. Some routes can be busy so reserve seat in advance when booking online.

You get a code back by email and then collect your ticket in the machine in the station. You can opt to display your name or a reservation number over the seat in the carriage which will indicate its taken (not always observed but people will usually move when asked- generally Irish people are polite travellers but occasionally can be a bit raucous when in large groups say travelling to a stag do or a sporting occasion). You are not permitted to consume alcohol on board by the way.

But city to city train travel is usually cheaper, handier than driving and you’ll see more on the train. Driving and train times are usually comparable on motorway routes and the train can edge it on routes like Killarney where there’s a decent non motorway leg after Limerick. However, bear in mind the car gets you door to door where you may have local travel to book end your train journey which can slow you down.

Travelling around Dublin.

Arrival in Dublin by Air

Dublin Airport bizarrely is not served by train. Options are taxis (plan on €30 fare depending on traffic to City centre and time of travel) or express coaches. Obviously a taxi may work
out cost effective for a group of 4.

If you’re on a tight budget Dublin airport is also served by local buses 41 and 16 which are pretty regular (41 runs 24 hours) if you buy a regular leap card (see below) in the airport before you leave it’s a €2 fare into the city centre, slightly more if paying cash and no change given of notes or credit/ debit cards accepted as of now (work
underway on this but it’s at least a year away). 

However 16/41 are not a tourist bus and therefore luggage space will be limited so if you’re hawking a large 20kg suitcase an
express bus will better serve your needs.

There are also a range of long distance coaches serving other regional cities from the airport, some
direct and bypassing Dublin City.

See https://www.dublinairport.com/to-from-the-airport/by-bus

Getting around Dublin

Dublin has three modes of public transport (all accept leap cards) as well as the Dublin Bike scheme which is very popular but limited to the inner city area.

There are also specialist tourist oriented city tour buses which allow you to hop on/off and have guide commentary. Heavily promoted in the city centre ( say on Dame Street in front of Trinity) and it’s unlikely you won’t see them.

Walking tours are also very popular- look on trip advisor for the highest rated ones- usually provided by knowledgeable and humorous local guides.

The new rolling stock is comfortable and all of the trains are clean. The old rollingstock that does the full route needs new seats, but again, it is clean. 

All irish rail services seem to be reliable. 

The issues are the speed and lack of onboard services. 

I can drive between dublin and cork in almost the same time as the train journey takes. Once you have added in any travel at either end, it is usually quicker to just drive. 

The wifi needs looked at also as its poor."

underway on this but it’s at least a year away). 

However 16/41 are not a tourist bus and therefore luggage space will be limited so if you’re hawking a large 20kg suitcase an
express bus will better serve your needs.

There are also a range of long distance coaches serving other regional cities from the airport, some
direct and bypassing Dublin City.

Getting around Dublin

Dublin has three modes of public transport (all accept leap cards) as well as the Dublin Bike scheme which is very popular but limited to the inner city area.

There are also specialist tourist oriented city tour buses which allow you to hop on/off and have guide commentary. Heavily promoted in the city centre ( say on Dame Street in front of Trinity) and it’s unlikely you won’t see them.

Walking tours are also very popular- look on trip advisor for the highest rated ones- usually provided by knowledgeable and humorous local guides.

Ticketing in Dublin public transport

It’s not necessary/ possible to buy commuter bus, tram or local train journeys in advance. All can be crowded during rush commuter hour but you’ll still get on (usually) though you might need to stand. As in any city at busy times pay attention to your luggage and be vigilant for pickpockets which are not unknown.

Buy bus tickets from the driver (you can pay with coins or notes but you won’t get change), you can pay for Luas or train tickets which are sold in machines at each Luas stop or train station. You can pay for Luas and train tickets using credit or debit cards but buses are cash only or tag on instead of buying a ticket using your leap card -

See below section on leap cards (both commuter and visitor )  for a convenient and low hassle approach to paying fares below. 

City buses - generally ok but not super easy to figure out the routes/ stops- use the TFI route planner or see https://www.dublinbus.ie/home.
Frequency is less good outside of peak times and the buses themselves are a mixture of new and old buses with some fairly shabby vehicles still in service (but bear in mind most journeys are short and they work ok as a means of getting to the many places not covered by Luas and Dart.

Tram is called the Luas and has two lines both of which traverse the city centre. Green line goes from Broombridge in Cabra on the Northside to Brides Glen in the south suburbs. 

The red line goes from the 3arena in the docklands to Saggart and Tallaght in the south west suburbs. 

Off the top of my head I can’t think of much tourist destinations on the Green line but the red line serves the National
Museum, Heuston (main intercity train station) as well as Kilmainham gaol. Guinness Storehouse/ brewery isn’t too far from Heuston stop either.

See map https://luas.ie/assets/files/Luas_Map.pdf

Commuter trains in Dublin are the Dart (running along Dublin Bay coast from
Malahide and Howth in the North to Bray and Greystones in the south and the southern part is a very picturesque trip along an historic railway line https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin_and_Kingstown_Railway?wprov=sfti1) and Arrow serving commuter suburbs to the west of the city.

Dublin BIke Scheme

These are literally everywhere in the city centre and there are plenty of bikes available across the network of bike stations 

1 day pass costs €3.50, €5 for
3 days 

They’ve added these short passes to the mobile app way of unlocking a bike which is the handiest
Once you’ve bought a pass most journeys are free (you only pay for journeys lasting more than 30 mins and Dublin is pretty compact and flat) see https://www.dublinbikes.ie/en/home

Student/Young person travel 

International students (as well as locals) studying full time can apply for a student leap card https://about.leapcard.ie/young-adult-and-student-card-launch which gives a 50% discount on travel. A similar young adult card (no requirement to be a full time student) isavailable also and soon to be extended (early 2024) to those aged 19 to 25. Discounts for student/YA cards apply to all fares nationwide not just those in the Dublin leap card ( commuter/ short hop) zone.

Leap Travel cards
There is a visitor leap card available which gives unlimited travel in the Dublin region at fixed prices

1 day (24 hours) – €8.00
3 days (72 hours) – €16.00
7 days (168 hours) – €32.00

These prices are less than the daily caps for regular leap cards so if you’re doing a lot of journeys they work out good value and you don’t have to worry about running out of credit. 

A regular (non visitor)  leap card costs €5 and it makes most sense if you’re only taking a few journeys which will be the case for many visitors as Dublin is compact enough to explore the city centre on foot.  if you’re spending a few days in Dublin the regular card may work out cheaper than a visitor card for light use. Leap card credit can be topped up in rail stations or using mobile app. 

Main advantages of leap cards are not having to worry about coins on buses which dont take credit cards and don’t give change of notes, flat €2 fare for 90 minute unlimited travel across multiple modes of transport and
discounts on the cash fare.  

Both types of regular/ visitor leap cards can be bought in the ticket machines in train stations and many retail agents https://about.leapcard.ie/about/where-to-buy

But you need to visit a specialist Student Leap agent to buy a student or young adult card as these require you to prove eligibility and have a photo taken.","I use public transport quite a lot and it doesn't tend to let me down too much. I think if you are prepared to do a bit of research and adjust your plans then you can have an okay experience, but really we shouldn't be at a point where that has to happen. The government and transport companies look at passenger numbers and think it is as high as can be be, rather than realising that there's a ton of people out there who would use it if they didn't have to wait two hours between services. The same problem is the reason they don't replace connections through the capital with direct services: sure people don't go from Cork to Sligo now, so why bother? It's this attitude that needs to change at all levels of power, otherwise we will be three decades down the road and Dublin will still dominate the country with all the current issues that it brings. Getting any form of public transport between cities is always going to be cheaper than the car, but the car drops you at your house not in a windswept station with no facilities and relying on a connecting service to finish your journey.

Irish Rail is very cheap compared to the UK, the problem is simply one of capacity and frequency. Things like staff, engine and driver numbers will always impose an upper ceiling on things but Irish Rail doesn't seem prepared to ramp up train numbers to bring in any latent demand. They think that the 9pm train being quiet is a reason not to put on an 11pm one, rather than realising that people are simply driving because there's no other option.

The intercity coaches are a good fallback if you need to get somewhere later at night, but my experience of these is solely travelling between Dublin and another city. You might get lucky if you happen to be on the end of a spur, so Limerick to Ennis or Cork to Tralee, or somewhere on the way, like Kildare village, but outside of that you are screwed. That said, I find the intercities are reliable and cheap, but as somebody else said, interacting with the driver on a basic question can drastically change your opinion. I don't know if it's because some services are government-run or because there is a driver shortage and they can get away with it, but the way some speak to passengers who are being polite and asking sensible questions is shocking. I totally understand that there are plenty of arsehole passengers too, but I actually see less of those compared to drivers kicking off.

In the cities the bus problem for me is that they simply don't run late enough, and then you are in the hands of taxi drivers who are openly turning meters off because they are never inspected. Same problem with the Luas and the Dart, which only cover a minority of the city anyway. Again I find the fares cheap, it's like 1.35 or something in Limerick, but I can imagine having to connect between services is no craic. Also I find the bus drivers seem to be much less unhinged than the coach drivers, although I figured they'd have much more reason to hate every passenger they see.

For my pipe dream, I'd have every city north and south connected by a direct service, as well as every university, port and airport. I'd have most of the arterial carriageways and all circular routes in Dublin, Cork, Belfast, Limerick, Derry and Galway have a tramline in the bus lane. Dublin has already re-designed the bus network based on this system. Any major European city, and most of the smaller ones, have this system. Lisbon had a massive tram network right across the oldest parts of town where routes wind around tiny hillside streets, the particular trams are smaller in those parts but even Porto, Prague, Cologne, Milan and Stockholm all have this. I've never used the rental bikes and scooters as I have my own and live in a small city, but I see plenty of young people and loads of tourists using them, probably a good alternative to ramming a bike into a one-bedroom apartment. I'd also personally collect and bury every single Leap card at the bottom of the sea and replace it with a contactless system that is seamless between services, meaning you get off a bus and onto a bike within 90 minutes and it is a single charge. 

We have to be serious about climate change but even if you don't give a shit about that, these are all things that exist in plenty of other places that we like to group ourselves into, and plenty of others we don't. For a small country with no major environmental challenges of freak weather events to contend with, as well as a massive budget surplus to spend, we should have a significant headstart on most other places, but we're crippled by parochialism, short-termism and a lack of strategic thinking. There's finally work being done on a rail link between Limerick and Foynes, and it only seemed to get over the line because they don't want rich Americans stuck in traffic for the Ryder Cup. The operator at Foynes and the EU was pleading with the government to re-open the line, and when they finally decided to, they forgot to survey the part of the line that goes to the cement factory. We're talking 2 or 3km of track that could take major freight traffic off the road, but as usual everyone thought it was somebody else's problem."
Experiences using Public transport in Ireland,"I’ve seen a lot of posts on this Reddit about how public transport in Ireland is terrible and not worth considering when travelling around the country. Sure there are gaps in coverage and now and again the bus in particular just randomly doesn’t turn up or is already full or late ( mainly because the operators are having difficulties recruiting).

Thought I’d start a thread here where locals and visitors could share their experiences. I have used intercity Irish rail, Dublin Bus , Luas and Dart extensively but have only limited experience using Bus Eireann. 

Overall,  it’s not terrible in my experience, far from it. 

Irish rail is great value and reasonably priced for long distance travel. Transport in Dublin is fine- the 90 minute fixed fare is super though obviously what we have doesn’t compare to larger cities like London in the reach and frequency. As a result the city can be congested though it impacts on all modes of transport especially buses and cars, the impact is less so on Luas and not at all on the dart.
You can make a reasonable argument that the buses and trains should have a lot more coverage and greater frequency but for the rail network what is there works really well, is fast, comfortable and for longer journeys is excellent value. As a for instance, the  train from Dublin to Galway booked online is €15 on a very comfortable train with a free seat reservation included. I think that’s good value for a c. 200km, 2.5 hour journey and compares well to other countries. I’ve paid far more in the UK for similar journeys. The petrol and motorway tolls to do that drive would cost you significantly more even driving a car you already own never mind having to hire one.

Among local users the satisfaction surveys are pretty good- see here https://www.transportforireland.ie/news/nta-publishes-results-of-customer-satisfaction-survey/

And stats around reliability https://www.irishrail.ie/en-ie/about-us/train-punctuality-reliability-performance

Can we get a more balanced and objective view to help visitors out?

Edit: There is some great real world feedback below- consensus I think that Irish rail is grand, if sometimes crowded and getting around Dublin by public transport is also pretty ok (with the acknowledged lunacy that you can’t reach the Airport other than by bus or taxi) but a lot of frustration with rural and intercity buses which are unreliable. Driving in Dublin generally won’t make much sense to those unfamiliar with the city, it’s fairly congested, parking is expensive and you’ll find it easier to get around the city centre where most of the sites are on foot, cycling or using public transport than trying to drive.

There is also a view that getting to key (scenic) tourist destinations outside the cities like the Cliffs of Moher and Ring of Kerry using public transport is much more problematic- it’s doable but relies on buses and can be slow which may not suit visitors whose time in Ireland may be constrained. A specialist day trip tour will likely suit your needs better. 

Suggestion: 

What would improve the rail system would be making easier to travel between regional cities, too much of the tracks radiate from
Dublin and it’s a palaver with multiple changes to get (say) from Killarney to Galway.

Given Irish rail operate extremely expensive tourist rail tours there may also be an argument for more focus on scheduled tourist oriented routes and expanding the bus network around tourist locations. 
As someone once said, build it and they will come.

Long distance trains

Buy and and plan intercity train journeys on https://www.irishrail.ie/en-ie/. Best prices available online and fares are the same price at all times, varying slightly for the amount of flexibility you want usually ok to buy a day or so in advance but may be booked out at very busy times. Some routes can be busy so reserve seat in advance when booking online.

You get a code back by email and then collect your ticket in the machine in the station. You can opt to display your name or a reservation number over the seat in the carriage which will indicate its taken (not always observed but people will usually move when asked- generally Irish people are polite travellers but occasionally can be a bit raucous when in large groups say travelling to a stag do or a sporting occasion). You are not permitted to consume alcohol on board by the way.

But city to city train travel is usually cheaper, handier than driving and you’ll see more on the train. Driving and train times are usually comparable on motorway routes and the train can edge it on routes like Killarney where there’s a decent non motorway leg after Limerick. However, bear in mind the car gets you door to door where you may have local travel to book end your train journey which can slow you down.

The thing with public transport is that it's not designed, the routes, for tourism. It likes the large urban centres, patchily sure, but if you want to get to say, the Cliff of Moher it doesn't do that easily.

Public transport requires time. Time that a lot of people on short vacations can't afford. Hell, we also tell them not to try drive the entire country in 4 days too because there's a balance, as in all things. 

Also, accessibility. Coach buses that traverse the country every day have either no, or extremely limited accessibility, so if you've a mobility issue, or a bladder issue tbh, coach transport can be really hit or miss. The trains don't go everywhere, can be overcrowded and at times, fucking expensive for what you're getting and while the trains themselves have way better accessibility, getting on and off them, and out of the stations even can prove very challenging for wheelchair users or people with ambulatory restrictions. 

Taxis, again, accessible taxis are few and far between. And if you have to go far in one, that's the cost of a car rent far the day even. 

Public transport is a great way to move a lot of people, but they also aren't the best way for everyone. 

So everyone needs to evaluate their needs, wants, time and budgets to go with the options that work best for them."
Experiences using Public transport in Ireland,"I’ve seen a lot of posts on this Reddit about how public transport in Ireland is terrible and not worth considering when travelling around the country. Sure there are gaps in coverage and now and again the bus in particular just randomly doesn’t turn up or is already full or late ( mainly because the operators are having difficulties recruiting).

Thought I’d start a thread here where locals and visitors could share their experiences. I have used intercity Irish rail, Dublin Bus , Luas and Dart extensively but have only limited experience using Bus Eireann. 

Overall,  it’s not terrible in my experience, far from it. 

Irish rail is great value and reasonably priced for long distance travel. Transport in Dublin is fine- the 90 minute fixed fare is super though obviously what we have doesn’t compare to larger cities like London in the reach and frequency. As a result the city can be congested though it impacts on all modes of transport especially buses and cars, the impact is less so on Luas and not at all on the dart.
You can make a reasonable argument that the buses and trains should have a lot more coverage and greater frequency but for the rail network what is there works really well, is fast, comfortable and for longer journeys is excellent value. As a for instance, the  train from Dublin to Galway booked online is €15 on a very comfortable train with a free seat reservation included. I think that’s good value for a c. 200km, 2.5 hour journey and compares well to other countries. I’ve paid far more in the UK for similar journeys. The petrol and motorway tolls to do that drive would cost you significantly more even driving a car you already own never mind having to hire one.

Among local users the satisfaction surveys are pretty good- see here https://www.transportforireland.ie/news/nta-publishes-results-of-customer-satisfaction-survey/

And stats around reliability https://www.irishrail.ie/en-ie/about-us/train-punctuality-reliability-performance

Can we get a more balanced and objective view to help visitors out?

Edit: There is some great real world feedback below- consensus I think that Irish rail is grand, if sometimes crowded and getting around Dublin by public transport is also pretty ok (with the acknowledged lunacy that you can’t reach the Airport other than by bus or taxi) but a lot of frustration with rural and intercity buses which are unreliable. Driving in Dublin generally won’t make much sense to those unfamiliar with the city, it’s fairly congested, parking is expensive and you’ll find it easier to get around the city centre where most of the sites are on foot, cycling or using public transport than trying to drive.

There is also a view that getting to key (scenic) tourist destinations outside the cities like the Cliffs of Moher and Ring of Kerry using public transport is much more problematic- it’s doable but relies on buses and can be slow which may not suit visitors whose time in Ireland may be constrained. A specialist day trip tour will likely suit your needs better. 

Suggestion: 

What would improve the rail system would be making easier to travel between regional cities, too much of the tracks radiate from
Dublin and it’s a palaver with multiple changes to get (say) from Killarney to Galway.

Given Irish rail operate extremely expensive tourist rail tours there may also be an argument for more focus on scheduled tourist oriented routes and expanding the bus network around tourist locations. 
As someone once said, build it and they will come.

Long distance trains

Buy and and plan intercity train journeys on https://www.irishrail.ie/en-ie/. Best prices available online and fares are the same price at all times, varying slightly for the amount of flexibility you want usually ok to buy a day or so in advance but may be booked out at very busy times. Some routes can be busy so reserve seat in advance when booking online.

You get a code back by email and then collect your ticket in the machine in the station. You can opt to display your name or a reservation number over the seat in the carriage which will indicate its taken (not always observed but people will usually move when asked- generally Irish people are polite travellers but occasionally can be a bit raucous when in large groups say travelling to a stag do or a sporting occasion). You are not permitted to consume alcohol on board by the way.

But city to city train travel is usually cheaper, handier than driving and you’ll see more on the train. Driving and train times are usually comparable on motorway routes and the train can edge it on routes like Killarney where there’s a decent non motorway leg after Limerick. However, bear in mind the car gets you door to door where you may have local travel to book end your train journey which can slow you down.

Travelling around Dublin.

Arrival in Dublin by Air

Dublin Airport bizarrely is not served by train. Options are taxis (plan on €30 fare depending on traffic to City centre and time of travel) or express coaches. Obviously a taxi may work
out cost effective for a group of 4.

If you’re on a tight budget Dublin airport is also served by local buses 41 and 16 which are pretty regular (41 runs 24 hours) if you buy a regular leap card (see below) in the airport before you leave it’s a €2 fare into the city centre, slightly more if paying cash and no change given of notes or credit/ debit cards accepted as of now (work
underway on this but it’s at least a year away). 

However 16/41 are not a tourist bus and therefore luggage space will be limited so if you’re hawking a large 20kg suitcase an
express bus will better serve your needs.

There are also a range of long distance coaches serving other regional cities from the airport, some
direct and bypassing Dublin City.

See https://www.dublinairport.com/to-from-the-airport/by-bus

Getting around Dublin

Dublin has three modes of public transport (all accept leap cards) as well as the Dublin Bike scheme which is very popular but limited to the inner city area.

There are also specialist tourist oriented city tour buses which allow you to hop on/off and have guide commentary. Heavily promoted in the city centre ( say on Dame Street in front of Trinity) and it’s unlikely you won’t see them.

Walking tours are also very popular- look on trip advisor for the highest rated ones- usually provided by knowledgeable and humorous local guides.

Ticketing in Dublin public transport

It’s not necessary/ possible to buy commuter bus, tram or local train journeys in advance. All can be crowded during rush commuter hour but you’ll still get on (usually) though you might need to stand. As in any city at busy times pay attention to your luggage and be vigilant for pickpockets which are not unknown.

Buy bus tickets from the driver (you can pay with coins or notes but you won’t get change), you can pay for Luas or train tickets which are sold in machines at each Luas stop or train station. You can pay for Luas and train tickets using credit or debit cards but buses are cash only or tag on instead of buying a ticket using your leap card -

See below section on leap cards (both commuter and visitor )  for a convenient and low hassle approach to paying fares below. 

City buses - generally ok but not super easy to figure out the routes/ stops- use the TFI route planner or see https://www.dublinbus.ie/home.
Frequency is less good outside of peak times and the buses themselves are a mixture of new and old buses with some fairly shabby vehicles still in service (but bear in mind most journeys are short and they work ok as a means of getting to the many places not covered by Luas and Dart.

Tram is called the Luas and has two lines both of which traverse the city centre. Green line goes from Broombridge in Cabra on the Northside to Brides Glen in the south suburbs. 

The red line goes from the 3arena in the docklands to Saggart and Tallaght in the south west suburbs. 

Off the top of my head I can’t think of much tourist destinations on the Green line but the red line serves the National
Museum, Heuston (main intercity train station) as well as Kilmainham gaol. Guinness Storehouse/ brewery isn’t too far from Heuston stop either.

See map https://luas.ie/assets/files/Luas_Map.pdf

Commuter trains in Dublin are the Dart (running along Dublin Bay coast from
Malahide and Howth in the North to Bray and Greystones in the south and the southern part is a very picturesque trip along an historic railway line https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin_and_Kingstown_Railway?wprov=sfti1) and Arrow serving commuter suburbs to the west of the city.

Dublin BIke Scheme

These are literally everywhere in the city centre and there are plenty of bikes available across the network of bike stations 

1 day pass costs €3.50, €5 for
3 days 

They’ve added these short passes to the mobile app way of unlocking a bike which is the handiest
Once you’ve bought a pass most journeys are free (you only pay for journeys lasting more than 30 mins and Dublin is pretty compact and flat) see https://www.dublinbikes.ie/en/home

Student/Young person travel 

International students (as well as locals) studying full time can apply for a student leap card https://about.leapcard.ie/young-adult-and-student-card-launch which gives a 50% discount on travel. A similar young adult card (no requirement to be a full time student) isavailable also and soon to be extended (early 2024) to those aged 19 to 25. Discounts for student/YA cards apply to all fares nationwide not just those in the Dublin leap card ( commuter/ short hop) zone.

Leap Travel cards
There is a visitor leap card available which gives unlimited travel in the Dublin region at fixed prices

1 day (24 hours) – €8.00
3 days (72 hours) – €16.00
7 days (168 hours) – €32.00

These prices are less than the daily caps for regular leap cards so if you’re doing a lot of journeys they work out good value and you don’t have to worry about running out of credit. 

A regular (non visitor)  leap card costs €5 and it makes most sense if you’re only taking a few journeys which will be the case for many visitors as Dublin is compact enough to explore the city centre on foot.  if you’re spending a few days in Dublin the regular card may work out cheaper than a visitor card for light use. Leap card credit can be topped up in rail stations or using mobile app. 

Main advantages of leap cards are not having to worry about coins on buses which dont take credit cards and don’t give change of notes, flat €2 fare for 90 minute unlimited travel across multiple modes of transport and
discounts on the cash fare.  

Both types of regular/ visitor leap cards can be bought in the ticket machines in train stations and many retail agents https://about.leapcard.ie/about/where-to-buy

But you need to visit a specialist Student Leap agent to buy a student or young adult card as these require you to prove eligibility and have a photo taken.","I would highly advise against using public transport in Ireland for a number of reasons.


**1. Expensive**
In comparison to other EU countries, it's ridiculously expensive. The train costs €22.50 to get from Dublin to Westport (probably more now) - in comparison, in France, you can travel a similar distance near Montpellier for €1. Buses here are also crazy expensive compared to the rest of Europe. It costs more to travel from Shannon Airport to Galway than it does to take a flight from Spain to Ireland.


**2. Lack of Quality**
I took a bus two weeks ago, there was one empty row at the back, when I got there, the entire seat was broken and pulled away from the back. You'll find the depths in the windows covered in years of dirt, not to mention the smell of shite. The same goes for trains. You'll have a sore arse after an hour journey.

**3. No Country for Students**
The NTA (The Irish body for national transport) recently banned all student cards for travelling, allowing only a special paid card which cannot be availed of by any student outside of Ireland (and many within Ireland, because lots of universities have recently changed their name and the system hasn't updated it). It's a 100% reduction. Ireland is the only country I've come across, which doesn't offer a student discount for international visitors.


**4. Loud Passengers**
Public transport in Ireland is unique in comparison to the rest of Europe, in that loud noise is generally accepted. One of the biggest changes for me living in another country coming from Ireland is how quiet public transport (in particular trains) was.


**5. Never on Time**
Public transport in Ireland is never on time, I have literally never taken a bus or train that arrived and departed on the time it was meant to. Generally, it's 20 minutes on either side of the expected time. Drivers don't give a shite, I was once on a bus which was an hour late and the driver got off to get a takeaway halfway through the journey."

You can pay for Luas and train tickets using credit or debit cards but buses are cash only or tag on instead of buying a ticket using your leap card -

See below section on leap cards (both commuter and visitor )  for a convenient and low hassle approach to paying fares below. 

City buses - generally ok but not super easy to figure out the routes/ stops- use the TFI route planner or see https://www.dublinbus.ie/home.
Frequency is less good outside of peak times and the buses themselves are a mixture of new and old buses with some fairly shabby vehicles still in service (but bear in mind most journeys are short and they work ok as a means of getting to the many places not covered by Luas and Dart.

Tram is called the Luas and has two lines both of which traverse the city centre. Green line goes from Broombridge in Cabra on the Northside to Brides Glen in the south suburbs. 

The red line goes from the 3arena in the docklands to Saggart and Tallaght in the south west suburbs. 

Off the top of my head I can’t think of much tourist destinations on the Green line but the red line serves the National
Museum, Heuston (main intercity train station) as well as Kilmainham gaol. Guinness Storehouse/ brewery isn’t too far from Heuston stop either.

Commuter trains in Dublin are the Dart (running along Dublin Bay coast from
Malahide and Howth in the North to Bray and Greystones in the south and the southern part is a very picturesque trip along an historic railway line https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin_and_Kingstown_Railway?wprov=sfti1) and Arrow serving commuter suburbs to the west of the city.

Dublin BIke Scheme

These are literally everywhere in the city centre and there are plenty of bikes available across the network of bike stations 

1 day pass costs €3.50, €5 for
3 days 

They’ve added these short passes to the mobile app way of unlocking a bike which is the handiest
Once you’ve bought a pass most journeys are free (you only pay for journeys lasting more than 30 mins and Dublin is pretty compact and flat) see https://www.dublinbikes.ie/en/home

Student/Young person travel 

International students (as well as locals) studying full time can apply for a student leap card https://about.leapcard.ie/young-adult-and-student-card-launch which gives a 50% discount on travel. A similar young adult card (no requirement to be a full time student) isavailable also and soon to be extended (early 2024) to those aged 19 to 25. Discounts for student/YA cards apply to all fares nationwide not just those in the Dublin leap card ( commuter/ short hop) zone.

Leap Travel cards
There is a visitor leap card available which gives unlimited travel in the Dublin region at fixed prices

1 day (24 hours) – €8.00
3 days (72 hours) – €16.00
7 days (168 hours) – €32.00

These prices are less than the daily caps for regular leap cards so if you’re doing a lot of journeys they work out good value and you don’t have to worry about running out of credit. 

A regular (non visitor)  leap card costs €5 and it makes most sense if you’re only taking a few journeys which will be the case for many visitors as Dublin is compact enough to explore the city centre on foot.  if you’re spending a few days in Dublin the regular card may work out cheaper than a visitor card for light use. Leap card credit can be topped up in rail stations or using mobile app. 

Main advantages of leap cards are not having to worry about coins on buses which dont take credit cards and don’t give change of notes, flat €2 fare for 90 minute unlimited travel across multiple modes of transport and
discounts on the cash fare.  

Both types of regular/ visitor leap cards can be bought in the ticket machines in train stations and many retail agents https://about.leapcard.ie/about/where-to-buy

But you need to visit a specialist Student Leap agent to buy a student or young adult card as these require you to prove eligibility and have a photo taken.",Great point- Irish rail and Translink jointly operate the Enterprise train between Dublin and Belfast and you can buy a ticket for this route from either provider but for other journeys in NI see the Translink site above.
Experiences using Public transport in Ireland,"I’ve seen a lot of posts on this Reddit about how public transport in Ireland is terrible and not worth considering when travelling around the country. Sure there are gaps in coverage and now and again the bus in particular just randomly doesn’t turn up or is already full or late ( mainly because the operators are having difficulties recruiting).

Thought I’d start a thread here where locals and visitors could share their experiences. I have used intercity Irish rail, Dublin Bus , Luas and Dart extensively but have only limited experience using Bus Eireann. 

Overall,  it’s not terrible in my experience, far from it. 

Irish rail is great value and reasonably priced for long distance travel. Transport in Dublin is fine- the 90 minute fixed fare is super though obviously what we have doesn’t compare to larger cities like London in the reach and frequency. As a result the city can be congested though it impacts on all modes of transport especially buses and cars, the impact is less so on Luas and not at all on the dart.
You can make a reasonable argument that the buses and trains should have a lot more coverage and greater frequency but for the rail network what is there works really well, is fast, comfortable and for longer journeys is excellent value. As a for instance, the  train from Dublin to Galway booked online is €15 on a very comfortable train with a free seat reservation included. I think that’s good value for a c. 200km, 2.5 hour journey and compares well to other countries. I’ve paid far more in the UK for similar journeys. The petrol and motorway tolls to do that drive would cost you significantly more even driving a car you already own never mind having to hire one.

Among local users the satisfaction surveys are pretty good- see here https://www.transportforireland.ie/news/nta-publishes-results-of-customer-satisfaction-survey/

And stats around reliability https://www.irishrail.ie/en-ie/about-us/train-punctuality-reliability-performance

Can we get a more balanced and objective view to help visitors out?

Edit: There is some great real world feedback below- consensus I think that Irish rail is grand, if sometimes crowded and getting around Dublin by public transport is also pretty ok (with the acknowledged lunacy that you can’t reach the Airport other than by bus or taxi) but a lot of frustration with rural and intercity buses which are unreliable. Driving in Dublin generally won’t make much sense to those unfamiliar with the city, it’s fairly congested, parking is expensive and you’ll find it easier to get around the city centre where most of the sites are on foot, cycling or using public transport than trying to drive.

There is also a view that getting to key (scenic) tourist destinations outside the cities like the Cliffs of Moher and Ring of Kerry using public transport is much more problematic- it’s doable but relies on buses and can be slow which may not suit visitors whose time in Ireland may be constrained. A specialist day trip tour will likely suit your needs better. 

Suggestion: 

What would improve the rail system would be making easier to travel between regional cities, too much of the tracks radiate from
Dublin and it’s a palaver with multiple changes to get (say) from Killarney to Galway.

Given Irish rail operate extremely expensive tourist rail tours there may also be an argument for more focus on scheduled tourist oriented routes and expanding the bus network around tourist locations. 
As someone once said, build it and they will come.

You get a code back by email and then collect your ticket in the machine in the station. You can opt to display your name or a reservation number over the seat in the carriage which will indicate its taken (not always observed but people will usually move when asked- generally Irish people are polite travellers but occasionally can be a bit raucous when in large groups say travelling to a stag do or a sporting occasion). You are not permitted to consume alcohol on board by the way.

But city to city train travel is usually cheaper, handier than driving and you’ll see more on the train. Driving and train times are usually comparable on motorway routes and the train can edge it on routes like Killarney where there’s a decent non motorway leg after Limerick. However, bear in mind the car gets you door to door where you may have local travel to book end your train journey which can slow you down.

Travelling around Dublin.

Arrival in Dublin by Air

Dublin Airport bizarrely is not served by train. Options are taxis (plan on €30 fare depending on traffic to City centre and time of travel) or express coaches. Obviously a taxi may work
out cost effective for a group of 4.

If you’re on a tight budget Dublin airport is also served by local buses 41 and 16 which are pretty regular (41 runs 24 hours) if you buy a regular leap card (see below) in the airport before you leave it’s a €2 fare into the city centre, slightly more if paying cash and no change given of notes or credit/ debit cards accepted as of now (work
underway on this but it’s at least a year away). 

However 16/41 are not a tourist bus and therefore luggage space will be limited so if you’re hawking a large 20kg suitcase an
express bus will better serve your needs.

There are also a range of long distance coaches serving other regional cities from the airport, some
direct and bypassing Dublin City.

See https://www.dublinairport.com/to-from-the-airport/by-bus

Getting around Dublin

Dublin has three modes of public transport (all accept leap cards) as well as the Dublin Bike scheme which is very popular but limited to the inner city area.

There are also specialist tourist oriented city tour buses which allow you to hop on/off and have guide commentary. Heavily promoted in the city centre ( say on Dame Street in front of Trinity) and it’s unlikely you won’t see them.

Walking tours are also very popular- look on trip advisor for the highest rated ones- usually provided by knowledgeable and humorous local guides.

Ticketing in Dublin public transport

It’s not necessary/ possible to buy commuter bus, tram or local train journeys in advance. All can be crowded during rush commuter hour but you’ll still get on (usually) though you might need to stand.

In response to some of the above comments, my purpose here was to get past a simplistic “Don’t even bother looking at public transport in Ireland” narrative which is wrong” to a nuanced and informative discussion of where it might be a useful option to consider.

On the carbon issue, the carbon impact of seven million plus visitors arriving is fixed (no other way for say North American visitors to get here for example) but the impact while here is at least partially an impact of the transit choices they make while they are here. 

I still maintain that trains are good value- in my experience the cost for a couple of a journey between cities is usually comparable or less than driving your own car when you factor fuel, wear and tear and tolls and significantly less than hiring a car but as you say, it only gets you so far and starts to fall down badly when exploring many of our most popular sights like the Ring of Kerry, Connemara and the Cliffs of Moher. 

I just wanted to put out there (acknowledging the very valid points you make about those with more limited mobility) that you can cover a lot and have a very enjoyable experience using trains to move between cities and then selecting some well chosen day tours by tourism oriented operators or by hiring a car locally to access the harder to reach spots."

If you’re on a tight budget Dublin airport is also served by local buses 41 and 16 which are pretty regular (41 runs 24 hours) if you buy a regular leap card (see below) in the airport before you leave it’s a €2 fare into the city centre, slightly more if paying cash and no change given of notes or credit/ debit cards accepted as of now (work
underway on this but it’s at least a year away). 

However 16/41 are not a tourist bus and therefore luggage space will be limited so if you’re hawking a large 20kg suitcase an
express bus will better serve your needs.

There are also a range of long distance coaches serving other regional cities from the airport, some
direct and bypassing Dublin City.

Getting around Dublin

Dublin has three modes of public transport (all accept leap cards) as well as the Dublin Bike scheme which is very popular but limited to the inner city area.

There are also specialist tourist oriented city tour buses which allow you to hop on/off and have guide commentary. Heavily promoted in the city centre ( say on Dame Street in front of Trinity) and it’s unlikely you won’t see them.

Walking tours are also very popular- look on trip advisor for the highest rated ones- usually provided by knowledgeable and humorous local guides.

Ticketing in Dublin public transport

It’s not necessary/ possible to buy commuter bus, tram or local train journeys in advance. All can be crowded during rush commuter hour but you’ll still get on (usually) though you might need to stand. As in any city at busy times pay attention to your luggage and be vigilant for pickpockets which are not unknown.

Buy bus tickets from the driver (you can pay with coins or notes but you won’t get change), you can pay for Luas or train tickets which are sold in machines at each Luas stop or train station. You can pay for Luas and train tickets using credit or debit cards but buses are cash only or tag on instead of buying a ticket using your leap card -

See below section on leap cards (both commuter and visitor )  for a convenient and low hassle approach to paying fares below. 

City buses - generally ok but not super easy to figure out the routes/ stops- use the TFI route planner or see https://www.dublinbus.ie/home.
Frequency is less good outside of peak times and the buses themselves are a mixture of new and old buses with some fairly shabby vehicles still in service (but bear in mind most journeys are short and they work ok as a means of getting to the many places not covered by Luas and Dart.

Tram is called the Luas and has two lines both of which traverse the city centre. Green line goes from Broombridge in Cabra on the Northside to Brides Glen in the south suburbs. 

The red line goes from the 3arena in the docklands to Saggart and Tallaght in the south west suburbs. 

Off the top of my head I can’t think of much tourist destinations on the Green line but the red line serves the National
Museum, Heuston (main intercity train station) as well as Kilmainham gaol. Guinness Storehouse/ brewery isn’t too far from Heuston stop either.

See map https://luas.ie/assets/files/Luas_Map.pdf

Commuter trains in Dublin are the Dart (running along Dublin Bay coast from
Malahide and Howth in the North to Bray and Greystones in the south and the southern part is a very picturesque trip along an historic railway line https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin_and_Kingstown_Railway?wprov=sfti1) and Arrow serving commuter suburbs to the west of the city.

Dublin BIke Scheme

These are literally everywhere in the city centre and there are plenty of bikes available across the network of bike stations 

1 day pass costs €3.50, €5 for
3 days 

They’ve added these short passes to the mobile app way of unlocking a bike which is the handiest
Once you’ve bought a pass most journeys are free (you only pay for journeys lasting more than 30 mins and Dublin is pretty compact and flat) see https://www.dublinbikes.ie/en/home

Student/Young person travel 

International students (as well as locals) studying full time can apply for a student leap card https://about.leapcard.ie/young-adult-and-student-card-launch which gives a 50% discount on travel. A similar young adult card (no requirement to be a full time student) isavailable also and soon to be extended (early 2024) to those aged 19 to 25. Discounts for student/YA cards apply to all fares nationwide not just those in the Dublin leap card ( commuter/ short hop) zone.

Leap Travel cards
There is a visitor leap card available which gives unlimited travel in the Dublin region at fixed prices

1 day (24 hours) – €8.00
3 days (72 hours) – €16.00
7 days (168 hours) – €32.00

These prices are less than the daily caps for regular leap cards so if you’re doing a lot of journeys they work out good value and you don’t have to worry about running out of credit. 

A regular (non visitor)  leap card costs €5 and it makes most sense if you’re only taking a few journeys which will be the case for many visitors as Dublin is compact enough to explore the city centre on foot.  if you’re spending a few days in Dublin the regular card may work out cheaper than a visitor card for light use. Leap card credit can be topped up in rail stations or using mobile app. 

Main advantages of leap cards are not having to worry about coins on buses which dont take credit cards and don’t give change of notes, flat €2 fare for 90 minute unlimited travel across multiple modes of transport and
discounts on the cash fare.  

Both types of regular/ visitor leap cards can be bought in the ticket machines in train stations and many retail agents https://about.leapcard.ie/about/where-to-buy

But you need to visit a specialist Student Leap agent to buy a student or young adult card as these require you to prove eligibility and have a photo taken.","I’ve done the Cliffs by public transport in a day from Dublin. It’s actually quite doable from Dublin, Limerick and Galway (maybe even Cork, I don’t know). The bus to/from the cliffs isn’t very frequent but it’s often enough to allow a day trip. I’ve even done Aran Islands as a day trip from Dublin. I don’t know what planet people live on thinking these places are unreachable by public transport"
Experiences using Public transport in Ireland,"I’ve seen a lot of posts on this Reddit about how public transport in Ireland is terrible and not worth considering when travelling around the country. Sure there are gaps in coverage and now and again the bus in particular just randomly doesn’t turn up or is already full or late ( mainly because the operators are having difficulties recruiting).

Thought I’d start a thread here where locals and visitors could share their experiences. I have used intercity Irish rail, Dublin Bus , Luas and Dart extensively but have only limited experience using Bus Eireann. 

Overall,  it’s not terrible in my experience, far from it. 

Irish rail is great value and reasonably priced for long distance travel. Transport in Dublin is fine- the 90 minute fixed fare is super though obviously what we have doesn’t compare to larger cities like London in the reach and frequency. As a result the city can be congested though it impacts on all modes of transport especially buses and cars, the impact is less so on Luas and not at all on the dart.
You can make a reasonable argument that the buses and trains should have a lot more coverage and greater frequency but for the rail network what is there works really well, is fast, comfortable and for longer journeys is excellent value. As a for instance, the  train from Dublin to Galway booked online is €15 on a very comfortable train with a free seat reservation included. I think that’s good value for a c. 200km, 2.5 hour journey and compares well to other countries. I’ve paid far more in the UK for similar journeys. The petrol and motorway tolls to do that drive would cost you significantly more even driving a car you already own never mind having to hire one.

Among local users the satisfaction surveys are pretty good- see here https://www.transportforireland.ie/news/nta-publishes-results-of-customer-satisfaction-survey/

And stats around reliability https://www.irishrail.ie/en-ie/about-us/train-punctuality-reliability-performance

Can we get a more balanced and objective view to help visitors out?

Edit: There is some great real world feedback below- consensus I think that Irish rail is grand, if sometimes crowded and getting around Dublin by public transport is also pretty ok (with the acknowledged lunacy that you can’t reach the Airport other than by bus or taxi) but a lot of frustration with rural and intercity buses which are unreliable. Driving in Dublin generally won’t make much sense to those unfamiliar with the city, it’s fairly congested, parking is expensive and you’ll find it easier to get around the city centre where most of the sites are on foot, cycling or using public transport than trying to drive.

There is also a view that getting to key (scenic) tourist destinations outside the cities like the Cliffs of Moher and Ring of Kerry using public transport is much more problematic- it’s doable but relies on buses and can be slow which may not suit visitors whose time in Ireland may be constrained. A specialist day trip tour will likely suit your needs better. 

Suggestion: 

What would improve the rail system would be making easier to travel between regional cities, too much of the tracks radiate from
Dublin and it’s a palaver with multiple changes to get (say) from Killarney to Galway.

Given Irish rail operate extremely expensive tourist rail tours there may also be an argument for more focus on scheduled tourist oriented routes and expanding the bus network around tourist locations. 
As someone once said, build it and they will come.

Planning a journey

Transport for Ireland is the national regulatory authority for public transportation (as well as taxis and cycling) and has a good journey planner here.

 (Google maps is often good also)

Long distance trains

Buy and and plan intercity train journeys on https://www.irishrail.ie/en-ie/. Best prices available online and fares are the same price at all times, varying slightly for the amount of flexibility you want usually ok to buy a day or so in advance but may be booked out at very busy times. Some routes can be busy so reserve seat in advance when booking online.

You get a code back by email and then collect your ticket in the machine in the station. You can opt to display your name or a reservation number over the seat in the carriage which will indicate its taken (not always observed but people will usually move when asked- generally Irish people are polite travellers but occasionally can be a bit raucous when in large groups say travelling to a stag do or a sporting occasion). You are not permitted to consume alcohol on board by the way.

But city to city train travel is usually cheaper, handier than driving and you’ll see more on the train. Driving and train times are usually comparable on motorway routes and the train can edge it on routes like Killarney where there’s a decent non motorway leg after Limerick. However, bear in mind the car gets you door to door where you may have local travel to book end your train journey which can slow you down.

Even reaching some B&Bs would not be possible without a car. The railway network is extremely limited in Ireland (in fact we had a larger network a century ago), so bus is the only option. Driving the small rural roads dotted with sheep is an experience in itself, and the cost of renting is also not so bad if sharing between 3-4 people and outside of summer months, in fact it can end up being cheaper than a train."

Cost- It would seem your experience of fares is somewhat out of date.

 A ticket on the SNCF website from Montpellier to Toulouse (slightly shorter distance to Dublin to Westport ) costs €15 to €38 depending on time of day. Dublin to Westport has been priced at €16 for some
time and is available on all trains if booked in advance.

Students- overseas full time students are entitled to apply for a student leap card just as Irish students are which gives significant discounts (50%) and it only costs €5 so it would most likely pay for itself in first journey.
A little overhead in collecting it, admittedly (you have to show eligibility documentation to  a Leap card agent) but there was a perception that student cards were being abused previously (I know some night students who applied for and use them for example) so they have obviously tightened up on their issue.


 https://about.leapcard.ie/young-adult-and-student-card-launch#eligible. 

I have family members who just started studying in a number of the universities who recently changed name (SETU, ATU, TUS) and they all had their student leap cards up and running a few weeks into term. 

Punctuality- you may have been extraordinarily unlucky but average punctuality on the Irish rail intercity network (defined as arriving within 10 mins of schedule) is currently averaging about 92% with reliability close to 100%. Buses as a number of posters have noted are considerably less reliable and punctual."

There is also a view that getting to key (scenic) tourist destinations outside the cities like the Cliffs of Moher and Ring of Kerry using public transport is much more problematic- it’s doable but relies on buses and can be slow which may not suit visitors whose time in Ireland may be constrained. A specialist day trip tour will likely suit your needs better. 

Suggestion: 

What would improve the rail system would be making easier to travel between regional cities, too much of the tracks radiate from
Dublin and it’s a palaver with multiple changes to get (say) from Killarney to Galway.

Given Irish rail operate extremely expensive tourist rail tours there may also be an argument for more focus on scheduled tourist oriented routes and expanding the bus network around tourist locations.

Long distance trains

Buy and and plan intercity train journeys on https://www.irishrail.ie/en-ie/. Best prices available online and fares are the same price at all times, varying slightly for the amount of flexibility you want usually ok to buy a day or so in advance but may be booked out at very busy times. Some routes can be busy so reserve seat in advance when booking online.

You get a code back by email and then collect your ticket in the machine in the station. You can opt to display your name or a reservation number over the seat in the carriage which will indicate its taken (not always observed but people will usually move when asked- generally Irish people are polite travellers but occasionally can be a bit raucous when in large groups say travelling to a stag do or a sporting occasion). You are not permitted to consume alcohol on board by the way.

But city to city train travel is usually cheaper, handier than driving and you’ll see more on the train. Driving and train times are usually comparable on motorway routes and the train can edge it on routes like Killarney where there’s a decent non motorway leg after Limerick. However, bear in mind the car gets you door to door where you may have local travel to book end your train journey which can slow you down.

Travelling around Dublin.

Arrival in Dublin by Air

Dublin Airport bizarrely is not served by train. Options are taxis (plan on €30 fare depending on traffic to City centre and time of travel) or express coaches. Obviously a taxi may work
out cost effective for a group of 4.

If you’re on a tight budget Dublin airport is also served by local buses 41 and 16 which are pretty regular (41 runs 24 hours) if you buy a regular leap card (see below) in the airport before you leave it’s a €2 fare into the city centre, slightly more if paying cash and no change given of notes or credit/ debit cards accepted as of now (work
underway on this but it’s at least a year away). 

However 16/41 are not a tourist bus and therefore luggage space will be limited so if you’re hawking a large 20kg suitcase an
express bus will better serve your needs.

There are also a range of long distance coaches serving other regional cities from the airport, some
direct and bypassing Dublin City.

See https://www.dublinairport.com/to-from-the-airport/by-bus

Getting around Dublin

Dublin has three modes of public transport (all accept leap cards) as well as the Dublin Bike scheme which is very popular but limited to the inner city area.

There are also specialist tourist oriented city tour buses which allow you to hop on/off and have guide commentary. Heavily promoted in the city centre ( say on Dame Street in front of Trinity) and it’s unlikely you won’t see them.

Walking tours are also very popular- look on trip advisor for the highest rated ones- usually provided by knowledgeable and humorous local guides.

Ticketing in Dublin public transport

It’s not necessary/ possible to buy commuter bus, tram or local train journeys in advance. All can be crowded during rush commuter hour but you’ll still get on (usually) though you might need to stand. As in any city at busy times pay attention to your luggage and be vigilant for pickpockets which are not unknown.

Buy bus tickets from the driver (you can pay with coins or notes but you won’t get change), you can pay for Luas or train tickets which are sold in machines at each Luas stop or train station. You can pay for Luas and train tickets using credit or debit cards but buses are cash only or tag on instead of buying a ticket using your leap card -

See below section on leap cards (both commuter and visitor )  for a convenient and low hassle approach to paying fares below. 

City buses - generally ok but not super easy to figure out the routes/ stops- use the TFI route planner or see https://www.dublinbus.ie/home.
Frequency is less good outside of peak times and the buses themselves are a mixture of new and old buses with some fairly shabby vehicles still in service (but bear in mind most journeys are short and they work ok as a means of getting to the many places not covered by Luas and Dart.

Tram is called the Luas and has two lines both of which traverse the city centre. Green line goes from Broombridge in Cabra on the Northside to Brides Glen in the south suburbs. 

The red line goes from the 3arena in the docklands to Saggart and Tallaght in the south west suburbs. 

Off the top of my head I can’t think of much tourist destinations on the Green line but the red line serves the National
Museum, Heuston (main intercity train station) as well as Kilmainham gaol. Guinness Storehouse/ brewery isn’t too far from Heuston stop either.

See map https://luas.ie/assets/files/Luas_Map.pdf

Commuter trains in Dublin are the Dart (running along Dublin Bay coast from
Malahide and Howth in the North to Bray and Greystones in the south and the southern part is a very picturesque trip along an historic railway line https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin_and_Kingstown_Railway?wprov=sfti1) and Arrow serving commuter suburbs to the west of the city.

Dublin BIke Scheme

These are literally everywhere in the city centre and there are plenty of bikes available across the network of bike stations 

1 day pass costs €3.50, €5 for
3 days 

They’ve added these short passes to the mobile app way of unlocking a bike which is the handiest
Once you’ve bought a pass most journeys are free (you only pay for journeys lasting more than 30 mins and Dublin is pretty compact and flat) see https://www.dublinbikes.ie/en/home

Student/Young person travel 

International students (as well as locals) studying full time can apply for a student leap card https://about.leapcard.ie/young-adult-and-student-card-launch which gives a 50% discount on travel. A similar young adult card (no requirement to be a full time student) isavailable also and soon to be extended (early 2024) to those aged 19 to 25. Discounts for student/YA cards apply to all fares nationwide not just those in the Dublin leap card ( commuter/ short hop) zone.

Leap Travel cards
There is a visitor leap card available which gives unlimited travel in the Dublin region at fixed prices

1 day (24 hours) – €8.00
3 days (72 hours) – €16.00
7 days (168 hours) – €32.00

These prices are less than the daily caps for regular leap cards so if you’re doing a lot of journeys they work out good value and you don’t have to worry about running out of credit. 

A regular (non visitor)  leap card costs €5 and it makes most sense if you’re only taking a few journeys which will be the case for many visitors as Dublin is compact enough to explore the city centre on foot.  if you’re spending a few days in Dublin the regular card may work out cheaper than a visitor card for light use. Leap card credit can be topped up in rail stations or using mobile app. 

Main advantages of leap cards are not having to worry about coins on buses which dont take credit cards and don’t give change of notes, flat €2 fare for 90 minute unlimited travel across multiple modes of transport and
discounts on the cash fare.  

Both types of regular/ visitor leap cards can be bought in the ticket machines in train stations and many retail agents https://about.leapcard.ie/about/where-to-buy

But you need to visit a specialist Student Leap agent to buy a student or young adult card as these require you to prove eligibility and have a photo taken.","There are massive capacity issues on some Irish rail trains e.g. Galway-Heuston service. The middle carriages will be packed full of people and then you have lots of seats booked by travel pass holders, particularly this time of year. 

Dated doesn't really bother me on the Dart either but some of the carriages are in awful shape. Some of the underground trains are very dated but it's a far superior service to anything we have here.

Also, for tourists, public transport isn't that important unless you're just going to stay in Dublin. Most people will just rent a car as we have a disjointed public transport network. MetroNorth will solve some of the problem but it won't dent the car rental market at Dublin airport IMO."
Experiences using Public transport in Ireland,"I’ve seen a lot of posts on this Reddit about how public transport in Ireland is terrible and not worth considering when travelling around the country. Sure there are gaps in coverage and now and again the bus in particular just randomly doesn’t turn up or is already full or late ( mainly because the operators are having difficulties recruiting).

Thought I’d start a thread here where locals and visitors could share their experiences. I have used intercity Irish rail, Dublin Bus , Luas and Dart extensively but have only limited experience using Bus Eireann. 

Overall,  it’s not terrible in my experience, far from it. 

Irish rail is great value and reasonably priced for long distance travel. Transport in Dublin is fine- the 90 minute fixed fare is super though obviously what we have doesn’t compare to larger cities like London in the reach and frequency. As a result the city can be congested though it impacts on all modes of transport especially buses and cars, the impact is less so on Luas and not at all on the dart.
You can make a reasonable argument that the buses and trains should have a lot more coverage and greater frequency but for the rail network what is there works really well, is fast, comfortable and for longer journeys is excellent value. As a for instance, the  train from Dublin to Galway booked online is €15 on a very comfortable train with a free seat reservation included. I think that’s good value for a c. 200km, 2.5 hour journey and compares well to other countries. I’ve paid far more in the UK for similar journeys. The petrol and motorway tolls to do that drive would cost you significantly more even driving a car you already own never mind having to hire one.

Among local users the satisfaction surveys are pretty good- see here https://www.transportforireland.ie/news/nta-publishes-results-of-customer-satisfaction-survey/

And stats around reliability https://www.irishrail.ie/en-ie/about-us/train-punctuality-reliability-performance

Can we get a more balanced and objective view to help visitors out?

By far it's the best form of wheelchair accessible travel, I know some stations are inaccessible and there's issues with ramps to get onto the train but the staff are excellent and do their best, plus there's a whole series of issues with the size of our railway guage that would pose challenges for fully accessibility. Now, Bus Eireann, as one poster rightly pointed out, can and is a fucking nightmare. Terrible accessibility outside of big towns and cities, they keep buying those stupid coaches with several steps in them. They're not practical for our rural roads and they give nonsense about needing the space for luggage. They gave attempted to buy coaches with fucking stupid lifts for wheelchair users that are overly complicated for the driver and wastes everyone's time instead of a simple pull out ramp. 

Citylink do a much better job, but I still believe in public transport, we have to use it and I hope we see more of it and more ease of access for people to use it. 

It's fucking embarrassing though that we have zero proper rail connection to Dublin airport, some shite private bus company (inaccessible in reality, some nonsense about a on board lift). Even Tallinn, a much smaller city, has a tram to the airport."

Experiences using Public transport in Ireland,"I’ve seen a lot of posts on this Reddit about how public transport in Ireland is terrible and not worth considering when travelling around the country. Sure there are gaps in coverage and now and again the bus in particular just randomly doesn’t turn up or is already full or late ( mainly because the operators are having difficulties recruiting).

Thought I’d start a thread here where locals and visitors could share their experiences. I have used intercity Irish rail, Dublin Bus , Luas and Dart extensively but have only limited experience using Bus Eireann. 

Overall,  it’s not terrible in my experience, far from it. 

Irish rail is great value and reasonably priced for long distance travel. Transport in Dublin is fine- the 90 minute fixed fare is super though obviously what we have doesn’t compare to larger cities like London in the reach and frequency. As a result the city can be congested though it impacts on all modes of transport especially buses and cars, the impact is less so on Luas and not at all on the dart.
You can make a reasonable argument that the buses and trains should have a lot more coverage and greater frequency but for the rail network what is there works really well, is fast, comfortable and for longer journeys is excellent value. As a for instance, the  train from Dublin to Galway booked online is €15 on a very comfortable train with a free seat reservation included. I think that’s good value for a c. 200km, 2.5 hour journey and compares well to other countries. I’ve paid far more in the UK for similar journeys. The petrol and motorway tolls to do that drive would cost you significantly more even driving a car you already own never mind having to hire one.

Among local users the satisfaction surveys are pretty good- see here https://www.transportforireland.ie/news/nta-publishes-results-of-customer-satisfaction-survey/

And stats around reliability https://www.irishrail.ie/en-ie/about-us/train-punctuality-reliability-performance

Can we get a more balanced and objective view to help visitors out?

Edit: There is some great real world feedback below- consensus I think that Irish rail is grand, if sometimes crowded and getting around Dublin by public transport is also pretty ok (with the acknowledged lunacy that you can’t reach the Airport other than by bus or taxi) but a lot of frustration with rural and intercity buses which are unreliable. Driving in Dublin generally won’t make much sense to those unfamiliar with the city, it’s fairly congested, parking is expensive and you’ll find it easier to get around the city centre where most of the sites are on foot, cycling or using public transport than trying to drive.

There is also a view that getting to key (scenic) tourist destinations outside the cities like the Cliffs of Moher and Ring of Kerry using public transport is much more problematic- it’s doable but relies on buses and can be slow which may not suit visitors whose time in Ireland may be constrained. A specialist day trip tour will likely suit your needs better. 

Suggestion: 

What would improve the rail system would be making easier to travel between regional cities, too much of the tracks radiate from
Dublin and it’s a palaver with multiple changes to get (say) from Killarney to Galway.

Given Irish rail operate extremely expensive tourist rail tours there may also be an argument for more focus on scheduled tourist oriented routes and expanding the bus network around tourist locations. 
As someone once said, build it and they will come.

Long distance trains

Buy and and plan intercity train journeys on https://www.irishrail.ie/en-ie/. Best prices available online and fares are the same price at all times, varying slightly for the amount of flexibility you want usually ok to buy a day or so in advance but may be booked out at very busy times. Some routes can be busy so reserve seat in advance when booking online.

You get a code back by email and then collect your ticket in the machine in the station. You can opt to display your name or a reservation number over the seat in the carriage which will indicate its taken (not always observed but people will usually move when asked- generally Irish people are polite travellers but occasionally can be a bit raucous when in large groups say travelling to a stag do or a sporting occasion). You are not permitted to consume alcohol on board by the way.

But city to city train travel is usually cheaper, handier than driving and you’ll see more on the train. Driving and train times are usually comparable on motorway routes and the train can edge it on routes like Killarney where there’s a decent non motorway leg after Limerick. However, bear in mind the car gets you door to door where you may have local travel to book end your train journey which can slow you down.

Travelling around Dublin.

Arrival in Dublin by Air

Dublin Airport bizarrely is not served by train. Options are taxis (plan on €30 fare depending on traffic to City centre and time of travel) or express coaches. Obviously a taxi may work
out cost effective for a group of 4.

If you’re on a tight budget Dublin airport is also served by local buses 41 and 16 which are pretty regular (41 runs 24 hours) if you buy a regular leap card (see below) in the airport before you leave it’s a €2 fare into the city centre, slightly more if paying cash and no change given of notes or credit/ debit cards accepted as of now (work
underway on this but it’s at least a year away). 

However 16/41 are not a tourist bus and therefore luggage space will be limited so if you’re hawking a large 20kg suitcase an
express bus will better serve your needs.

There are also a range of long distance coaches serving other regional cities from the airport, some
direct and bypassing Dublin City.

See https://www.dublinairport.com/to-from-the-airport/by-bus

Getting around Dublin

Dublin has three modes of public transport (all accept leap cards) as well as the Dublin Bike scheme which is very popular but limited to the inner city area.

There are also specialist tourist oriented city tour buses which allow you to hop on/off and have guide commentary. Heavily promoted in the city centre ( say on Dame Street in front of Trinity) and it’s unlikely you won’t see them.

Walking tours are also very popular- look on trip advisor for the highest rated ones- usually provided by knowledgeable and humorous local guides.

Ticketing in Dublin public transport

It’s not necessary/ possible to buy commuter bus, tram or local train journeys in advance. All can be crowded during rush commuter hour but you’ll still get on (usually) though you might need to stand. As in any city at busy times pay attention to your luggage and be vigilant for pickpockets which are not unknown.

Buy bus tickets from the driver (you can pay with coins or notes but you won’t get change), you can pay for Luas or train tickets which are sold in machines at each Luas stop or train station. You can pay for Luas and train tickets using credit or debit cards but buses are cash only or tag on instead of buying a ticket using your leap card -

See below section on leap cards (both commuter and visitor )  for a convenient and low hassle approach to paying fares below. 

City buses - generally ok but not super easy to figure out the routes/ stops- use the TFI route planner or see https://www.dublinbus.ie/home.
Frequency is less good outside of peak times and the buses themselves are a mixture of new and old buses with some fairly shabby vehicles still in service (but bear in mind most journeys are short and they work ok as a means of getting to the many places not covered by Luas and Dart.

Tram is called the Luas and has two lines both of which traverse the city centre. Green line goes from Broombridge in Cabra on the Northside to Brides Glen in the south suburbs. 

The red line goes from the 3arena in the docklands to Saggart and Tallaght in the south west suburbs. 

Off the top of my head I can’t think of much tourist destinations on the Green line but the red line serves the National
Museum, Heuston (main intercity train station) as well as Kilmainham gaol. Guinness Storehouse/ brewery isn’t too far from Heuston stop either.

See map https://luas.ie/assets/files/Luas_Map.pdf

Commuter trains in Dublin are the Dart (running along Dublin Bay coast from
Malahide and Howth in the North to Bray and Greystones in the south and the southern part is a very picturesque trip along an historic railway line https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin_and_Kingstown_Railway?wprov=sfti1) and Arrow serving commuter suburbs to the west of the city.

Dublin BIke Scheme

These are literally everywhere in the city centre and there are plenty of bikes available across the network of bike stations 

1 day pass costs €3.50, €5 for
3 days 

They’ve added these short passes to the mobile app way of unlocking a bike which is the handiest
Once you’ve bought a pass most journeys are free (you only pay for journeys lasting more than 30 mins and Dublin is pretty compact and flat) see https://www.dublinbikes.ie/en/home

Student/Young person travel 

International students (as well as locals) studying full time can apply for a student leap card https://about.leapcard.ie/young-adult-and-student-card-launch which gives a 50% discount on travel. A similar young adult card (no requirement to be a full time student) isavailable also and soon to be extended (early 2024) to those aged 19 to 25. Discounts for student/YA cards apply to all fares nationwide not just those in the Dublin leap card ( commuter/ short hop) zone.

Leap Travel cards
There is a visitor leap card available which gives unlimited travel in the Dublin region at fixed prices

1 day (24 hours) – €8.00
3 days (72 hours) – €16.00
7 days (168 hours) – €32.00

These prices are less than the daily caps for regular leap cards so if you’re doing a lot of journeys they work out good value and you don’t have to worry about running out of credit. 

A regular (non visitor)  leap card costs €5 and it makes most sense if you’re only taking a few journeys which will be the case for many visitors as Dublin is compact enough to explore the city centre on foot.  if you’re spending a few days in Dublin the regular card may work out cheaper than a visitor card for light use. Leap card credit can be topped up in rail stations or using mobile app. 

Main advantages of leap cards are not having to worry about coins on buses which dont take credit cards and don’t give change of notes, flat €2 fare for 90 minute unlimited travel across multiple modes of transport and
discounts on the cash fare.  

Both types of regular/ visitor leap cards can be bought in the ticket machines in train stations and many retail agents https://about.leapcard.ie/about/where-to-buy

But you need to visit a specialist Student Leap agent to buy a student or young adult card as these require you to prove eligibility and have a photo taken.","Excuse me, can you do a little more research before you ""fact check"" because you're wrong on a lot of things here.

For a start, you need to look at the €1 options being offered by SNCF and just searched for a random route. Here is a list to get you started so you can inform yourself: https://www.ter.sncf.com/occitanie/tarifs-cartes/billets-un-euro

Also, Irish Rail doesn't offer a flat rate of €16, looking at the trains right now, the closest one is €18 which is still ridiculously expensive compared to the rest of Europe.

Regarding the Student Leap Card, to apply online, you have to enter a university that is on its system. Unfortunately, this is impossible for non-Irish residents as it doesn't recognise universities outside of Ireland. It doesn't even recognise my university, which is Irish, and has changed its name recently. Plus you have to collect the card from an agent which is only available in big cities, which makes it impossible for international visitors. Again, Ireland is the only country in Europe that I'm aware of such ridiculous restrictions.

Intercity is obviously going to run on better punctuality because of the short distance of journeys. Come back to me with figures on punctuality on rural transport and we'll talk."

A similar young adult card (no requirement to be a full time student) isavailable also and soon to be extended (early 2024) to those aged 19 to 25. Discounts for student/YA cards apply to all fares nationwide not just those in the Dublin leap card ( commuter/ short hop) zone.

Leap Travel cards
There is a visitor leap card available which gives unlimited travel in the Dublin region at fixed prices

1 day (24 hours) – €8.00
3 days (72 hours) – €16.00
7 days (168 hours) – €32.00

These prices are less than the daily caps for regular leap cards so if you’re doing a lot of journeys they work out good value and you don’t have to worry about running out of credit. 

A regular (non visitor)  leap card costs €5 and it makes most sense if you’re only taking a few journeys which will be the case for many visitors as Dublin is compact enough to explore the city centre on foot.  if you’re spending a few days in Dublin the regular card may work out cheaper than a visitor card for light use. Leap card credit can be topped up in rail stations or using mobile app. 

Main advantages of leap cards are not having to worry about coins on buses which dont take credit cards and don’t give change of notes, flat €2 fare for 90 minute unlimited travel across multiple modes of transport and
discounts on the cash fare.  

Both types of regular/ visitor leap cards can be bought in the ticket machines in train stations and many retail agents https://about.leapcard.ie/about/where-to-buy

But you need to visit a specialist Student Leap agent to buy a student or young adult card as these require you to prove eligibility and have a photo taken.","Ok, I’ll be serious 😬

Most times I’ve used the train, it’s been slow, packed and late. Would be quicker to drive between Galway and Dublin than take the train. 

The last bus eireann I took was 35 mins late for pickup (there was no explanation at the bus station and no indication about what time it was arriving) . Good job I wasn’t under pressure to arrive in my destination at a specific time. 

Dublin bus was hit and miss. Busses were dirty. To be expected in a city maybe but the last bus I was on looked like it had never been cleaned since it first went into service. 

There was a general lack of integration between the different forms of public transport. Maybe this has improved since the Luas was introduced (I’ve not had the pleasure yet). 

Irish public transport is very poor compared to other countries such as Sweden. I’m sure there are many other European countries which we could look towards for top quality public transport services at a decent price."
Experiences using Public transport in Ireland,"I’ve seen a lot of posts on this Reddit about how public transport in Ireland is terrible and not worth considering when travelling around the country. Sure there are gaps in coverage and now and again the bus in particular just randomly doesn’t turn up or is already full or late ( mainly because the operators are having difficulties recruiting).

Thought I’d start a thread here where locals and visitors could share their experiences. I have used intercity Irish rail, Dublin Bus , Luas and Dart extensively but have only limited experience using Bus Eireann. 

Overall,  it’s not terrible in my experience, far from it. 

Irish rail is great value and reasonably priced for long distance travel. Transport in Dublin is fine- the 90 minute fixed fare is super though obviously what we have doesn’t compare to larger cities like London in the reach and frequency. As a result the city can be congested though it impacts on all modes of transport especially buses and cars, the impact is less so on Luas and not at all on the dart.
You can make a reasonable argument that the buses and trains should have a lot more coverage and greater frequency but for the rail network what is there works really well, is fast, comfortable and for longer journeys is excellent value. As a for instance, the  train from Dublin to Galway booked online is €15 on a very comfortable train with a free seat reservation included. I think that’s good value for a c. 200km, 2.5 hour journey and compares well to other countries. I’ve paid far more in the UK for similar journeys. The petrol and motorway tolls to do that drive would cost you significantly more even driving a car you already own never mind having to hire one.

Among local users the satisfaction surveys are pretty good- see here https://www.transportforireland.ie/news/nta-publishes-results-of-customer-satisfaction-survey/

And stats around reliability https://www.irishrail.ie/en-ie/about-us/train-punctuality-reliability-performance

Can we get a more balanced and objective view to help visitors out?

Edit: There is some great real world feedback below- consensus I think that Irish rail is grand, if sometimes crowded and getting around Dublin by public transport is also pretty ok (with the acknowledged lunacy that you can’t reach the Airport other than by bus or taxi) but a lot of frustration with rural and intercity buses which are unreliable. Driving in Dublin generally won’t make much sense to those unfamiliar with the city, it’s fairly congested, parking is expensive and you’ll find it easier to get around the city centre where most of the sites are on foot, cycling or using public transport than trying to drive.

There is also a view that getting to key (scenic) tourist destinations outside the cities like the Cliffs of Moher and Ring of Kerry using public transport is much more problematic- it’s doable but relies on buses and can be slow which may not suit visitors whose time in Ireland may be constrained. A specialist day trip tour will likely suit your needs better. 

Suggestion: 

What would improve the rail system would be making easier to travel between regional cities, too much of the tracks radiate from
Dublin and it’s a palaver with multiple changes to get (say) from Killarney to Galway.

Given Irish rail operate extremely expensive tourist rail tours there may also be an argument for more focus on scheduled tourist oriented routes and expanding the bus network around tourist locations. 
As someone once said, build it and they will come.

Long distance trains

Buy and and plan intercity train journeys on https://www.irishrail.ie/en-ie/. Best prices available online and fares are the same price at all times, varying slightly for the amount of flexibility you want usually ok to buy a day or so in advance but may be booked out at very busy times. Some routes can be busy so reserve seat in advance when booking online.

You get a code back by email and then collect your ticket in the machine in the station. You can opt to display your name or a reservation number over the seat in the carriage which will indicate its taken (not always observed but people will usually move when asked- generally Irish people are polite travellers but occasionally can be a bit raucous when in large groups say travelling to a stag do or a sporting occasion). You are not permitted to consume alcohol on board by the way.

But city to city train travel is usually cheaper, handier than driving and you’ll see more on the train. Driving and train times are usually comparable on motorway routes and the train can edge it on routes like Killarney where there’s a decent non motorway leg after Limerick. However, bear in mind the car gets you door to door where you may have local travel to book end your train journey which can slow you down.

Travelling around Dublin.

Arrival in Dublin by Air

Dublin Airport bizarrely is not served by train. Options are taxis (plan on €30 fare depending on traffic to City centre and time of travel) or express coaches. Obviously a taxi may work
out cost effective for a group of 4.

If you’re on a tight budget Dublin airport is also served by local buses 41 and 16 which are pretty regular (41 runs 24 hours) if you buy a regular leap card (see below) in the airport before you leave it’s a €2 fare into the city centre, slightly more if paying cash and no change given of notes or credit/ debit cards accepted as of now (work
underway on this but it’s at least a year away). 

However 16/41 are not a tourist bus and therefore luggage space will be limited so if you’re hawking a large 20kg suitcase an
express bus will better serve your needs.

There are also a range of long distance coaches serving other regional cities from the airport, some
direct and bypassing Dublin City.

See https://www.dublinairport.com/to-from-the-airport/by-bus

Getting around Dublin

Dublin has three modes of public transport (all accept leap cards) as well as the Dublin Bike scheme which is very popular but limited to the inner city area.

There are also specialist tourist oriented city tour buses which allow you to hop on/off and have guide commentary. Heavily promoted in the city centre ( say on Dame Street in front of Trinity) and it’s unlikely you won’t see them.

Walking tours are also very popular- look on trip advisor for the highest rated ones- usually provided by knowledgeable and humorous local guides.

Ticketing in Dublin public transport

It’s not necessary/ possible to buy commuter bus, tram or local train journeys in advance. All can be crowded during rush commuter hour but you’ll still get on (usually) though you might need to stand. As in any city at busy times pay attention to your luggage and be vigilant for pickpockets which are not unknown.

Buy bus tickets from the driver (you can pay with coins or notes but you won’t get change), you can pay for Luas or train tickets which are sold in machines at each Luas stop or train station. You can pay for Luas and train tickets using credit or debit cards but buses are cash only or tag on instead of buying a ticket using your leap card -

See below section on leap cards (both commuter and visitor )  for a convenient and low hassle approach to paying fares below. 

City buses - generally ok but not super easy to figure out the routes/ stops- use the TFI route planner or see https://www.dublinbus.ie/home.
Frequency is less good outside of peak times and the buses themselves are a mixture of new and old buses with some fairly shabby vehicles still in service (but bear in mind most journeys are short and they work ok as a means of getting to the many places not covered by Luas and Dart.

Tram is called the Luas and has two lines both of which traverse the city centre. Green line goes from Broombridge in Cabra on the Northside to Brides Glen in the south suburbs. 

The red line goes from the 3arena in the docklands to Saggart and Tallaght in the south west suburbs. 

Off the top of my head I can’t think of much tourist destinations on the Green line but the red line serves the National
Museum, Heuston (main intercity train station) as well as Kilmainham gaol. Guinness Storehouse/ brewery isn’t too far from Heuston stop either.

See map https://luas.ie/assets/files/Luas_Map.pdf

Commuter trains in Dublin are the Dart (running along Dublin Bay coast from
Malahide and Howth in the North to Bray and Greystones in the south and the southern part is a very picturesque trip along an historic railway line https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin_and_Kingstown_Railway?wprov=sfti1) and Arrow serving commuter suburbs to the west of the city.

Dublin BIke Scheme

These are literally everywhere in the city centre and there are plenty of bikes available across the network of bike stations 

1 day pass costs €3.50, €5 for
3 days 

They’ve added these short passes to the mobile app way of unlocking a bike which is the handiest
Once you’ve bought a pass most journeys are free (you only pay for journeys lasting more than 30 mins and Dublin is pretty compact and flat) see https://www.dublinbikes.ie/en/home

Have family in East Galway and all of the local towns are no longer served by Bus Eireann where they used to be part of the Dublin to Galway route. It will indicate the satisfaction with the other local provider who remains that they are known locally as ShittyLink though personally I’ve found them ok if very slow compared to trains.

Considering accessibility it’s also unacceptable that wheelchair users travelling by train have to give 24 hours notice of travel for assistance and so many lifts are routinely out of order."

Tram is called the Luas and has two lines both of which traverse the city centre. Green line goes from Broombridge in Cabra on the Northside to Brides Glen in the south suburbs. 

The red line goes from the 3arena in the docklands to Saggart and Tallaght in the south west suburbs. 

Off the top of my head I can’t think of much tourist destinations on the Green line but the red line serves the National

Dublin BIke Scheme

These are literally everywhere in the city centre and there are plenty of bikes available across the network of bike stations 

1 day pass costs €3.50, €5 for
3 days 

They’ve added these short passes to the mobile app way of unlocking a bike which is the handiest
Once you’ve bought a pass most journeys are free (you only pay for journeys lasting more than 30 mins and Dublin is pretty compact and flat) see https://www.dublinbikes.ie/en/home

Student/Young person travel 

International students (as well as locals) studying full time can apply for a student leap card https://about.leapcard.ie/young-adult-and-student-card-launch which gives a 50% discount on travel. A similar young adult card (no requirement to be a full time student) isavailable also and soon to be extended (early 2024) to those aged 19 to 25. Discounts for student/YA cards apply to all fares nationwide not just those in the Dublin leap card ( commuter/ short hop) zone.

Leap Travel cards
There is a visitor leap card available which gives unlimited travel in the Dublin region at fixed prices

1 day (24 hours) – €8.00
3 days (72 hours) – €16.00
7 days (168 hours) – €32.00

These prices are less than the daily caps for regular leap cards so if you’re doing a lot of journeys they work out good value and you don’t have to worry about running out of credit. 

A regular (non visitor)  leap card costs €5 and it makes most sense if you’re only taking a few journeys which will be the case for many visitors as Dublin is compact enough to explore the city centre on foot.  if you’re spending a few days in Dublin the regular card may work out cheaper than a visitor card for light use. Leap card credit can be topped up in rail stations or using mobile app. 

Main advantages of leap cards are not having to worry about coins on buses which dont take credit cards and don’t give change of notes, flat €2 fare for 90 minute unlimited travel across multiple modes of transport and
discounts on the cash fare.  

Both types of regular/ visitor leap cards can be bought in the ticket machines in train stations and many retail agents https://about.leapcard.ie/about/where-to-buy

But you need to visit a specialist Student Leap agent to buy a student or young adult card as these require you to prove eligibility and have a photo taken.","Fair comments on the buses I think. On the train yes they definitely can be crowded (and I know the Galway train well). I think you’re being a bit harsh about train punctuality. They do sometimes arrive late to intermediate stations but they generally seem to make it up by the time they reach the destination.
 That’s broadly reflected in the punctuality stats from Irish Rail noted in the main post, with anything more than 10 mins reported as unpunctual. And driving time for the route per Google maps is equivalent at 2.5 hours to the train time.

But you’re right in saying we need to learn from other countries and we’re nowhere near the best countries like the Scandinavians"
Experiences using Public transport in Ireland,"I’ve seen a lot of posts on this Reddit about how public transport in Ireland is terrible and not worth considering when travelling around the country. Sure there are gaps in coverage and now and again the bus in particular just randomly doesn’t turn up or is already full or late ( mainly because the operators are having difficulties recruiting).

Thought I’d start a thread here where locals and visitors could share their experiences. I have used intercity Irish rail, Dublin Bus , Luas and Dart extensively but have only limited experience using Bus Eireann. 

Overall,  it’s not terrible in my experience, far from it. 

Irish rail is great value and reasonably priced for long distance travel. Transport in Dublin is fine- the 90 minute fixed fare is super though obviously what we have doesn’t compare to larger cities like London in the reach and frequency. As a result the city can be congested though it impacts on all modes of transport especially buses and cars, the impact is less so on Luas and not at all on the dart.
You can make a reasonable argument that the buses and trains should have a lot more coverage and greater frequency but for the rail network what is there works really well, is fast, comfortable and for longer journeys is excellent value. As a for instance, the  train from Dublin to Galway booked online is €15 on a very comfortable train with a free seat reservation included. I think that’s good value for a c. 200km, 2.5 hour journey and compares well to other countries. I’ve paid far more in the UK for similar journeys. The petrol and motorway tolls to do that drive would cost you significantly more even driving a car you already own never mind having to hire one.

Among local users the satisfaction surveys are pretty good- see here https://www.transportforireland.ie/news/nta-publishes-results-of-customer-satisfaction-survey/

And stats around reliability https://www.irishrail.ie/en-ie/about-us/train-punctuality-reliability-performance

Can we get a more balanced and objective view to help visitors out?

Edit: There is some great real world feedback below- consensus I think that Irish rail is grand, if sometimes crowded and getting around Dublin by public transport is also pretty ok (with the acknowledged lunacy that you can’t reach the Airport other than by bus or taxi) but a lot of frustration with rural and intercity buses which are unreliable. Driving in Dublin generally won’t make much sense to those unfamiliar with the city, it’s fairly congested, parking is expensive and you’ll find it easier to get around the city centre where most of the sites are on foot, cycling or using public transport than trying to drive.

There is also a view that getting to key (scenic) tourist destinations outside the cities like the Cliffs of Moher and Ring of Kerry using public transport is much more problematic- it’s doable but relies on buses and can be slow which may not suit visitors whose time in Ireland may be constrained. A specialist day trip tour will likely suit your needs better. 

Suggestion: 

What would improve the rail system would be making easier to travel between regional cities, too much of the tracks radiate from
Dublin and it’s a palaver with multiple changes to get (say) from Killarney to Galway.

Given Irish rail operate extremely expensive tourist rail tours there may also be an argument for more focus on scheduled tourist oriented routes and expanding the bus network around tourist locations. 
As someone once said, build it and they will come.

Planning a journey

Transport for Ireland is the national regulatory authority for public transportation (as well as taxis and cycling) and has a good journey planner here.

https://www.transportforireland.ie/plan-a-journey/
 (Google maps is often good also)

Long distance trains

Buy and and plan intercity train journeys on https://www.irishrail.ie/en-ie/. Best prices available online and fares are the same price at all times, varying slightly for the amount of flexibility you want usually ok to buy a day or so in advance but may be booked out at very busy times. Some routes can be busy so reserve seat in advance when booking online.

You get a code back by email and then collect your ticket in the machine in the station. You can opt to display your name or a reservation number over the seat in the carriage which will indicate its taken (not always observed but people will usually move when asked- generally Irish people are polite travellers but occasionally can be a bit raucous when in large groups say travelling to a stag do or a sporting occasion). You are not permitted to consume alcohol on board by the way.

But city to city train travel is usually cheaper, handier than driving and you’ll see more on the train. Driving and train times are usually comparable on motorway routes and the train can edge it on routes like Killarney where there’s a decent non motorway leg after Limerick. However, bear in mind the car gets you door to door where you may have local travel to book end your train journey which can slow you down.

(some feedback that timetables can be a bit loose and some popular routes in tourist areas may be busy so bear this in mind if your travel is time sensitive)

Travelling around Dublin.

Arrival in Dublin by Air

Dublin Airport bizarrely is not served by train. Options are taxis (plan on €30 fare depending on traffic to City centre and time of travel) or express coaches. Obviously a taxi may work
out cost effective for a group of 4.

If you’re on a tight budget Dublin airport is also served by local buses 41 and 16 which are pretty regular (41 runs 24 hours) if you buy a regular leap card (see below) in the airport before you leave it’s a €2 fare into the city centre, slightly more if paying cash and no change given of notes or credit/ debit cards accepted as of now (work
underway on this but it’s at least a year away). 

However 16/41 are not a tourist bus and therefore luggage space will be limited so if you’re hawking a large 20kg suitcase an
express bus will better serve your needs.

There are also a range of long distance coaches serving other regional cities from the airport, some
direct and bypassing Dublin City.

See https://www.dublinairport.com/to-from-the-airport/by-bus

Getting around Dublin

Dublin has three modes of public transport (all accept leap cards) as well as the Dublin Bike scheme which is very popular but limited to the inner city area.

There are also specialist tourist oriented city tour buses which allow you to hop on/off and have guide commentary. Heavily promoted in the city centre ( say on Dame Street in front of Trinity) and it’s unlikely you won’t see them.

Walking tours are also very popular- look on trip advisor for the highest rated ones- usually provided by knowledgeable and humorous local guides.

Ticketing in Dublin public transport

It’s not necessary/ possible to buy commuter bus, tram or local train journeys in advance. All can be crowded during rush commuter hour but you’ll still get on (usually) though you might need to stand. As in any city at busy times pay attention to your luggage and be vigilant for pickpockets which are not unknown.

Buy bus tickets from the driver (you can pay with coins or notes but you won’t get change), you can pay for Luas or train tickets which are sold in machines at each Luas stop or train station. You can pay for Luas and train tickets using credit or debit cards but buses are cash only or tag on instead of buying a ticket using your leap card -

I don’t know if it would help but on the assumption that most tourists using public transport travel from Dublin to Galway and Galway to the Cliffs/ Doolin, the bus route then continues to Ennis from the Cliffs so (I’m theorising here now, don’t know for sure if this is true) possibly the bus may be less busy going south from the Cliffs to Ennis. 

So an option might be to get train (slightly less convenient than the Galway train) to Ennis and buck the trend by getting the bus North, and on your return head south to Ennis unfortunately you’ll miss the Burren which is on the bus journey north from Doolin to Galway and very memorable scenery in my view.  Another possible option would be Dublin Galway (train) Doolin/Cliffs by bus, bus to Ennis and train back to Dublin from Ennis which at least avoids the risk that say the bus to Galway in Doolin has already filled up at the Cliffs. That route through Ennis would set you up well to head to Killarney or Cork if that was part of your itinerary.

As I say you’d need to get someone with personal experience to confirm this. You could always ring Ennis or Galway Bus station for advice as well."
How good is public transport in Ireland?,"Hey there, my friend and I are planning to go on vacation and we are thinking about going to Ireland. I wanted to ask how reliable and affordable public transport between different cities is. Or would it be better if we rented a car if we wanted to visit more than one city?","Between major urban centres, it's fine. You'll normally have a bus, sometimes more than one competing operator and some places you'd also have the train. 

But if you wanted to get further afield then it starts to get tricky. Rural Ireland relies heavily on taxis if the local buses don't go where you need, and those aren't especially cheap.

When's the trip and what sort of places are on the list to go see?"

I wanted to ask how reliable and affordable public transport between different cities is.

Car rental and gas prices are so high that you could take a whole other vacation with that money! We took buses and trains the whole time. We took Gobus from Dublin to Galway and back. In Dublin, the DART will take you out to surrounding villages, and in Galway, the regional buses and train will do the same. It's totally doable, although the buses in Dublin were quite crowded.
We were quite pleased with the public transportation, since where we live in the US, there's pretty much nothing!
Other areas, yes, you would need a car. We hoped for some scenic drives, but, we couldn't afford the car rental. We did take a day tour and saw we lot of beautiful countryside. We still had a great time and saw so much! The Irish people are friendly and quite amazing, so you will have a wonderful time! Planning our next trip😃"

A lot of the country roads can be narrow and windy with not a lot of space. On the other hand they can be quieter too, so you might not encounter many cars. Wearing a hi-viz jacket or band could be a good idea. 

Towns and villages should be fine, along with major tourist areas. There's also been some work to develop Greenways, walking and cycling routes through scenic areas, as well as some hiking routes, for example by the Cliffs of Moher.  I'm fairly certain there's an app or website that sets out different hiking routes but hopefully someone more knowledgeable than me will be along to advise!

Cycling the Ring of Kerry is fairly popular so you might find it easy enough to rent bikes when you're in Killarney.

Ireland is a relatively safe place. I don't think I've ever seen a hitchhiker to be honest so I'm not sure that it's very common. If you are doing this I'd suggest taking some safety precautions e.g. let someone on the farm know your plans.

I'd like to take some day trips to various towns around the country, and maybe make stops en route to a place. If I'm in, for example, Thurles, is there a website that would list: here is every bus and train heading out of Thurles with the times and destinations?

Most websites need an end destination, but I'm interested in the smaller towns that I might not necessarily be aware of. I think typically these have some local bus going to and from a larger town. Is there any way (online) of identifying these routes?","https://www.transportforireland.ie/tfi-local-link/

Don't know if there's any one site with what you are asking for but 
if you look at the Bus Eireann, CIE and Local Link sites you should be able to find a good chunk of options.

Visiting Ireland for 18 days in late November - early December. Relying on public transport. Please critique my itinerary!,"I loved the friendliness I experienced when I was in Dublin for 2 days. Howth was lovely too.

I would like to walk around and experience the culture/historical stuff (what's ""authentic Ireland"" like?), drink Guinness and experience how different it tastes between areas, experience nature. I'm also into museums, cafes, plant-based food. **I am also teaching myself Gaeilge and it would be cool to use it or be around places that use it.**

Here's my rough itinerary for 18 days. This is a solo trip. I like a slow pace.

Day 1 - Arrive in Dublin airport. Take the bus to Galway.

Day 2 - Galway --- explore city centre (city museum, spanish arch, eyre square, latin quarter). Drink Guinness.

Day 3 - Galway --- Connemara day trip (tour).

Day 4 - Galway --- Cliffs of Moher day trip (tour).

Day 5 - Galway -- free exploration.

Day 6 - Galway -- free exploration.

(I'm not too interested in checking out the Aran Islands considering this trip will be in early winter)

...

Day 7 - Leave Galway. Go to Cork.

Day 8 - Cork for a full day. (English Market, and the Castle Inn for Guinness).

Day 9 - Leave Cork. Go to Kilkenny for a day trip (Medieval Mile, John Cleere for Guinness).

....

Day 10 - Leave Kilkenny. Go to Dublin.

Day 11 - Dublin -- Chill out, rest day. Recover.

Day 12 - Dublin -- Giant's Causeway tour.

Day 13 - Dublin -- Visit some pubs, eat some vegan food.

Day 14 - Dublin -- Aon Scéal Cafe, Books Upstairs, National Museum.

Day 15 - Dublin -- Chill out.

Day 16 - 18 -- ????

I have 18 days available, so I have **3** unplanned days to make use of for this trip.

**QUESTIONS:**

1. Should I stay in Cork longer? If so, what are some things I could do there?
2. Should I go to Limerick after Galway and before Cork?
3. What are some other things I should check out not mentioned here? Are there other cities that'd fit this plan? Are there things in mentioned cities that would interest me?

Thank you in advance!","I used all public transport and it was fantastic ! But when you get out to Galway the bus system starts to slow down a bit , they have regional 18 seat busses you can call and give them 15 bucks to take you to places.  In Galway don’t forget to take “the long walk” to clear your head and make your way over to the “salt hill” area I recommend the Oslow pub it’s a beer hall, pub, and dinning all in one. 

If your feeling daring I went 4 hours north of Galway to donegal and the wild Atlantic way ! , took a small bus to “slieve league” it’s the highest cliff face in all of Europe 2-3 hour round trip hike to the peak .  Higher than cliffs of moher ,

With that said in Dublin def do the Guinness factory , James factory , Dublin castle , dame street tavern for as local as it gets pub , Trinity college.  St Patrick’s Cathedral.  

Not sure about the speaking the language thing I only ever experienced it when I was in the north country , everyone is super friendly and up for a quick convo that’s where you get the best recommendations from"

Thank you in advance!","Giants causeway is not in Ireland, its in the UK, in Northern Ireland, why not go spend a few days in Belfast and you can use public transport to get there i will post below on how to do that 

would recommend you DONT do a prebooked tour as you don't get much time at each location, ok given using public transport takes effort and time but at least you can take your time etc, its very easy to do as i said before, just take the train from Great Victoria Street Train station  in Belfast (entrance is beside europa hotel marked ""Great Northern Mall"" follow the corridor down to the bus station and turn left then right into the Train station), Buy a £17.50 Zone 4 I-link card this gives you unlimited travel on all Bus and trains anywhere in Northern Ireland for 1 day travel (you can get for a week and a month if you are here that long lol), Jump on the train to Derry/Londonderry @ Great Victoria Street Train station, change in Coleraine after 1hr 25 min of a journey on the train to COLERAINE the bus and train station in Coleraine is under one roof go in and catch the Ulsterbus 402 service to Ballycastle this drops you off yards from the Giants causeway visitor centre, do not go into it as its a tourist trap, go down to the stones via the tunnel to the right of the visitor centre, (when in the bus station/train station walk to the end of the station the bus departures go from the far end of the building there is departures board there listing the departures)  
public transport in Northern Ireland is operated by Translink (www.translink.co.uk)

Rent a Car VS other Forms of Transportation - Solo Traveler in Ireland,"Hello all,

I will be solo traveling to Ireland for 9 days in September 2022. I am on the fence about renting a car (unfortunately I do not know how to drive stick) or using other forms of transportation. i.e. trains, buses, etc etc.  (or a combination of both)

I like the concept of driving the countryside in my own car (I am a capable and confident driver, even on the left side of the road), and generally dislike being a part of large tour group.  However, it would be convenient to be able to relax while being transported via train, bus, etc.

I will fly into Dublin and would like to spend 2/3 of my time in the southern countryside and 1/3 of my time in Cork, before returning to Dublin to fly home.

&#x200B;

I am open to all suggestions, and thank you in advance!

&#x200B;

\*\* side notes: I am a 33 years old graduate student on a budget, and am flexible with traveling. I will have one large suitcase with me - open to suggestions on that as well!","I’d trade out the large suitcase for a Hiking backpack I think, as will be easier on public transport. Although a rolling suitcase will suit, a backpack may be easier. This would be especially important if you choose to rent a bike, as you can’t transport a suitcase on a bike.

Cars are insanely expensive to rent in Ireland at the moment. But, it is possible to rent an automatic. I normally go through Costco, but good luck.

Other than that, you’d be okay taking public transport depending on where you want to go. Trains run regularly between Dublin and Galway. You can get busses that go south to Cork. There also may be a train, but I’ve  ever taken that one.  Just use Google Maps or Rome2Rio to plan your route.

In town, the Irish bus system is pretty good. Just buy a Leap Card at the train station or the local Gas station/ convenience store and keep it topped up.

Bikes are available to rent around Dublin, Galway and Cork for a small daily fee. However, there is a pretty large deposit for security.

Going out in the countryside is a bit tough since busses/taxis won’t get you out that far. 

You may want to see if there are any local meetup or hiking groups that you can catch a lift from."

Check the price of the car and also factor in the $8-9 a gallon gas, and decide whether that will be in your budget. 

We knew it was not in our budget, and ended up spending $250 on public transportation for 2 people, in 2 weeks, and we saw a whole lot. You can also consider the occasional day tour for places where a car is a must. 

 Travel light for sure! Downgrade to one rolling carryon or large backpack and you'll be all set. It's a lot of walking here and there, and if you're moving around a lot, you'll be happier travelling light. There are places to do laundry. I think we overpacked....next time it's 2 shirts, 2 jeans, fleece sweater, rain jacket, socks, thermals, underwear, waterproof shoes and done! 

(There's also limited room on buses for luggage. They have luggage racks, but they're not huge)."

I will have one large suitcase with me - open to suggestions on that as well!","Yes, Cork will have better access to go elsewhere, but if he goes to Kinsale it would be the same cost staying in Kinsale and bussing back to Cork as it would if he just went there for a day trip.  He hasn’t decided though if he’s doing public transport or a rental car though, that’s why my comment focused on if he chooses a rental car.  Even if he chooses public transport though, he shouldn’t waste 1/3rd of his trip in the Cork, I’d suggest a day and night in Kinsale, and part of a day maybe visiting a couple of the worth while spots in the Cork area, then move on elsewhere"
Rent a Car VS other Forms of Transportation - Solo Traveler in Ireland,"Hello all,

I will be solo traveling to Ireland for 9 days in September 2022. I am on the fence about renting a car (unfortunately I do not know how to drive stick) or using other forms of transportation. i.e. trains, buses, etc etc.  (or a combination of both)

I like the concept of driving the countryside in my own car (I am a capable and confident driver, even on the left side of the road), and generally dislike being a part of large tour group.  However, it would be convenient to be able to relax while being transported via train, bus, etc.

I will fly into Dublin and would like to spend 2/3 of my time in the southern countryside and 1/3 of my time in Cork, before returning to Dublin to fly home.

"Planning a week in Ireland this March, and have a few Dublin transportation and lodging questions","We're planning a visit to Ireland in late March, visiting from the US (Oregon).  We're looking at two nights in Dublin, two nights in Belfast, and three nights in Southern Ireland (Kilkenny, perhaps).  Essentially, we're hoping to get a feel for the cities, visit the Titanic museum, and see some castles and ruins.

We're traveling as a family of six -- my wife and I plus our four ""children"" aged 20, 18, 16, 15.  

I was looking at Aircoach for transportation from the Airport to the city center.  But we are also considering the DoDoublin hop-on/hop-off bus, and I noticed a ""Freedom Ticket"" that includes the tour bus as well as airport transfers.  

* Are we able to take luggage on the airport transfers in the Freedom ticket? 
* Is the Freedom Ticket a good deal, with just two nights (\~2 days) in Dublin?

We're also looking at lodging options, and Dublin hotels seems a bit expensive.  We found some reasonable priced options in Belfast, and I was surprised by the difference.

* Are there any good, affordable Dublin lodging options we should consider for a family of six? 

With the Freedom Ticket, we could use rail lines to access lodging options a bit further away, I suppose.  

* Is it reasonable to look farther out from the city center for lodging in Dublin, relying on public transportation?

Also appreciate any thoughts on the southern part of the trip.  We plan to rent a car for these days, and had considered finding a bed and breakfast as our base for a few nights.

* Any good recommendations for B&Bs that we should consider?

Thanks for any advice.  Really excited for our visit!","Hey! I don’t have answers for all of your questions, but here’s a few. I took a carry on size suitcase on a few Dublin buses throughout the city and had zero trouble, and I imagine the airport bus would be the same, if not more accommodating. I looked up the Freedom Ticket and it’s €45 for one adult, so probably €270 for your family. Single bus rides in Dublin are ~€2.60, so if we round up, that would mean needing to take 100 rides (or your whole family ride the bus 16 times) for the public transport aspect to be worth it. I stayed in an outer neighborhood of Dublin (Donnybrook) and was able to get the bus and be in town in 20 minutes. I would usually just take it in the morning to my first destination, walk everywhere during the day, and take it back at night. All the usual touristy spots in Dublin are pretty close together & walkable barring exigent circumstances, and if not they’re just another €2.60 bus ride away. As for the Hop On-Hop Off bus part of the I have no experience, like I said things are pretty walkable, so the drawing aspect of this would have to be the tour guide aspect- could be fun! Like I said, I stayed further out from the city center, and had no problem getting a bus every day, so it would definitely be reasonable to look for accommodation out there, especially with the size of your family! I found the Google Maps public transport option very helpful in telling me how I could get where I wanted. Best of luck for your trip!"

With very limited luggage capacity. I've done both the 16 and Aircoach to and from the airport and I'll pick the Aircoach every time if I can possibly afford it. 

Anecdotally, you're late to booking for March in a reduced capacity situation to begin with. Looking along the Dart line is always a plan but no guarantee that you'll get cheaper."

Transportation for a week in Ireland?,"Hello! We have a group of 13 that will be touring Ireland next August. I’m currently leaning toward renting 3 larger vehicles and driving ourselves around but wanted to see what others thought. 

Pros: can go wherever/whenever we want and cost effective

Cons: we are used to driving on the right (Wisconsin) and most of our group have not been to Ireland previously, so they are unaware of what a true narrow road looks like.

Any other suggestions? Good private busses that could accommodate an already planned itinerary (From Dublin to Dingle seeing as much as possible in between)?

Thank you all!!","I would say car is your best bet. Where are you flying into? Driving around dublin can be daunting, and check out the parking availablity in the cities before you go in. Buses in Ireland are, in my opinion, awful. The trains are nice, but limit you hugely as you can't go everywhere."

Thank you all!!","Buses will not be allowed down some of the narrow roads you're talking about because, well, they'd get STUCK.

What you need are minivans. I know a group of Dutch people (they were 7) who got a minivan and were able to fit everyone and their bags in without any problems. However, they did agree to limit their luggage in advance to one suitcase per person, and stayed in a house with a washer/dryer. But two of those vehicles should sort ye. 

Might be an idea to hire a driver as well, and have one or two of your group drive the other vehicle."

Thank you all!!","Ireland isn't all narrow roads.  We have plenty of motorways and wide roads too.  You will encounter some narrow ones in the more remote areas, but a lot of your travels will be on good roads.  For anything you might find challenging, just drive carefully.  You could hire a minibus to carry you all and give you some freedom, maybe two if necessary.  Ireland is only half the size of Wisconsin, so you can drive from Dublin on the east coast to Galway on the west coast  in less than 3 hours, in good traffic.  Clifden is a bit further on.  A night in Galway city is good and then do a day trip to Clifden and back.  Galway to Clifden isn't exactly high quality roads, but it is a scenic drive.  You can take your time and make plenty of stops along the way.

Your arrival time in Dublin could be a factor in deciding what to do next, also the condition you are in after your flight.  So staying a night in Dublin could be a good idea.  The city is close to the airport and well served by buses.  It is only about 6 miles away.  So perhaps spend your first night in Dublin and head west after that.  Maybe pick up the rental vehicles on the day you leave Dublin.  Not much point in hiring one to drive just 6 miles and trying to navigate your way around a strange city, when public transport will get you to where you want to go.  Maybe revisit your itinerary and think about what way you want to go and how long to stay in Dublin.  

Maybe Head to Galway first after Dublin, a night or two there taking in Clifden, and then head south towards Limerick, with a diversion off to see the famous Cliffs of Moher.  Past Limerick you will head further south to county Kerry, where Dingle is.  That area of the country is nice.  Your route could take you back towards Limerick and then it is motorway all the way to Dublin.  Alternatively you might head towards Cork and even on towards the southeast with Waterford and Wexford on your itinerary.  I don't know when you are coming or how long you are staying, but with a bit of planning, you could get a lot in."

2-**How's the public transportation in Ireland, any tips you can give me?**(I have a driving license and I'm a responsible driver, but since Ireland drives on the left side, I want to avoid accidents or risking someone's life, so doing my best not renting a car.)  
  
3-**Night life tips**(I'm a charismatic guy and always love to meet new people, especially Irish people since I'm so interested in their culture, I saw some Pubs recommended to me, would love some more.  
  
I'm a guitarist, I love hiking(although I have a bad knee injury atm but I can manage small-mid hikes), I love nature a lot, so I do my best to visit it, I'm kind of depressed atm because I went through a tough breakup, so I would love to explore some night life if I have the time, I'm a university student so my budget isn't huge but I would sacrifice some money if something is worth it, that's about it.

Day 1: Dublin

Day 8: Chill in Dublin and wait for flight.  
  
Dublin Zoo","1. The weather will be variable. Bring layers that you can strip on and off. It can go from cold and windy to hot and humid quite quickly if you're outdoors. A light rainproof outer layer is mandatory.

2. Public transportation overall isn't great, especially between rural areas. If, for example, you want to take public transport from Dublin to Glendalough, you might have trouble unless you go with a tour. And there's no connection between Glendalough and Galway at all. Public transportation in downtown Dublin will suit you just fine. My advice is to rent a car as soon as you leave Dublin!

3. I can't speak too much for the night life. Pubs in Temple Bar are more popular with tourists and hen parties than locals. Pubs like O'Donoghue's and the rest in that area are more popular with locals. The young college crowd frequent the clubs along Harcourt and Camden street to the south. Don't get your expectations up to high though!

It's a decent itinerary, though most days will be busy. The only things I'd make note of are:

- The spinc trail and miners village at Glendalough is easily a 6 hour hike for a person in moderate shape. Its roughly 10km roundtrip from the upper car park and 13km roundtrip from the lower car park. Unless you have the time, I would either hike to the top of the ridge by heading south from the upper lake, or I would just hike out to the miners village and back.
- Taking a tour boat from Galway to the Aran islands saves you the time instead of driving to Doolin first. You will only have time to do one island, and I'd recommend Inishmore. Check to make sure the tours still run in October and book ahead!
- Galway to Dublin to Bushmills is a long drive, but easy because it's all on the motorway. You might not have time to stop in the Mournes since they're a ways off the road. If you have time, you might be able to stop and see Slieve Gullion? It's a passage tomb at the top of a short hike if you park near the top.

Have fun!"
Just some thoughts as I end my visit in Ireland…,"We’ve stayed mostly in Dublin this trip (with a day trip Cork and Cobh) and I have a few observations I’ll share!

1.) if this is your first time in Europe or Ireland for that matter, definitely make it a point to see as many historical markers as possible. We have nothing like it in the USA. Make it a point to leave bigger cities and see other parts of this gorgeous island!

2.) the food is better than I thought. I did a solo trip to London last year and I swear I nearly starved. ((((edit: This comment has upset more people than intended- I stand by what I say about London- I had recommendations from friends who traveled there along with asking locals and I was disappointed. Do I blame LONDON AND THE IT’S CITIZENS AS A WHOLE??? No. Please calm down 😂I had a great time in London despite feeling robbed of whole food/tasty meals. Would love everyone’s recommendations for my next visit.))))I hate to say I expected the same here. I’ve been pleasantly surprised! While you’ll see a lot of the same items on menus, I’ve eaten some truly delicious meals here! Favorite so far was the bacon and cabbage at Brazen Head 🤤

3.) I come from the northwest- after being here I realize how lovely it is to find communities of people genuinely interested in you. Not just because you’re a tourist, but because you’re a person. Everywhere we’ve gone people have been really very sweet- a few clearly annoyed folks trying to commute on tourist crammed busses and trains, but beside that all so sweet. The northwest “freeze” is real 😅 I almost felt inept in socializing because I’m not used to it!

4.) Getting around is very easy here. Cabs and busses galore. If you’re stressing about transportation- don’t. 

5.) Ok- nearly post about Temple Bar on here was negative. I get it. It’s expensive. But I have to say we’ve had a couple of fun experiences in pubs in Temple Bar and I think everyone who has the chance to have a few pints in the area definitely should. Yes, it’s a tourist trap, but I think it would be like telling someone going to New Orleans NOT to go to Bourbon Street or the French Quarter because it’s too ~*touristy*~ and overpriced. If you live here? Yes I totally get why you don’t want to spend your free nights out there. But if you’re visiting? Just go. Everyone is lovely. Even the English “bros” falling over themselves 😂😂😂

Ireland! Thank you for your true hospitality. This has been a favorite trip for my husband and I. ❤️","My wife and I traveled all across Ireland a number of years ago, driving about 1000 miles over the course of 2 weeks. We ate all kinds of different food at all kinds of different B&Bs, pubs, and restaurants. We, of course had beef and lamb stew, but also some really delicious sandwiches, seafood, Full Irish Breakfasts, burgers, and small plates. We did not have any complaints about the flavor or quality of the food.  

We started in Dublin, drove through Glendalough, to Kilkenny, then through Cashel, to Cork. We made quick side trips to Cobh and Blarney from Cork, then drove on through Kinsale to Kenmare via the Wild Atlantic Way. Starting and finishing in Kenmare, we drove the Ring of Kerry and the Skellig Ring in a clockwise direction, opposite the way that any tour buses are required to drive. Next, we stopped at Bunratty Castle and the Cliffs of Moher before staying over in Doolin. From there we drove through the Burren and Kinvara to get to Galway where we spent a couple nights just down the street from the rugby stadium. We did a whiskey tour, went to Galway Crystal, and did the Long Walk. From Galway, we went to the village of Cong where we stayed a night at Ashford Castle. While at the castle, we explored the grounds, had a glorious high-tea, and took a guided hawk walk through the Ireland School of Falconry. From Cong, we went back to Dublin via Headford to see Ross Errilly Friary. We flew out of Dublin, back to the U.S. the next afternoon."

But I have to say we’ve had a couple of fun experiences in pubs in Temple Bar and I think everyone who has the chance to have a few pints in the area definitely should. Yes, it’s a tourist trap, but I think it would be like telling someone going to New Orleans NOT to go to Bourbon Street or the French Quarter because it’s too ~*touristy*~ and overpriced. If you live here? Yes I totally get why you don’t want to spend your free nights out there. But if you’re visiting? Just go. Everyone is lovely. Even the English “bros” falling over themselves 😂😂😂

Ireland! Thank you for your true hospitality. This has been a favorite trip for my husband and I. ❤️",You think Irish public transport is good? Jesus. It must be *awful-to-non-existent* in the US then.

I’m 27F(Asian American) from Hawaii and my first solo trip to Europe is getting closer. I will be visiting Scotland, Ireland, Prague and London around October.
I’ve joined this community for further travel tips and I’ve previously posted here asking about my interest with Halloween Celebrations in Ireland which I received plenty helpful feedbacks. 
I’ve return to humbly ask for advice.
Your honest and reliable opinion will be kindly appreciated.

1. Is it safe for a solo female and(relatively asian)to be walking alone while visiting historical sites or attractions in Dublin for a day or 2?
Most specially attending the gatherings at night to watch celebrations on the week of Halloween?

2. With just having 4 nights: 3 1/2 days , Is it possible/achievable to visit other great cities like Galway by bus or other friendly public transportations?

3. If you were in my position who has many interests like history, arts, architectures, landscapes, photography, nature destinations, foods, and non alcoholic drinks, what would you do with 4 nights: 3 1/2 days in Ireland ?

4. What places should I visit based on my interest and given time as mentioned above? 

5. I have psoriatic arthritis and severe cold weather has to be avoided to prevent flare ups.  We don’t have snow here in the island but one particular island of Hawaii has. Honolulu County  is often pleasantly warm, windy and raining.
Is it going very cold in late October?

6. What are some major or common mistakes that tourists often do and what are the things to avoid that we don’t know?

I apologize to everyone who are reading this and for asking a lot. 
You have my warmest thanks and gratitude.
It’s been my dream and goal to visit Ireland and many other countries before my health condition persist. 

Huge Mahalo and sending positive thoughts to everybody. 🌺","1) Yes. Apply common sense like you would in any city.

2) Public transport in Ireland is not great. Having said that, from Dublin you would be able to take a number of different day trips. Galway and Belfast would be two examples easily within reach. If I were you I'd go on an organised tour bus though, take the hassle out of it

3) Belfast and Dublin will tick the history boxes. Plenty of beautiful sights all over Ireland if you're into nature and photography, but seeing as you mentioned Galway already, that's where I'd recommend. Although most of the beauty is found an hour or more outside the city

4) As above?

5) Irish weather is not predictable. Late October is PROBABLY a bit too early for snow but you could get some very cold and wet weather if you're unlucky (maybe 3-4C). If you're lucky, the weather could be dry and in the mid to high teens. And if everything is normal, you're probably looking at high single digits or low double digits. If very cold weather is a deal breaker then do NOT come in October! May-June are statistically the driest months and temperatures should be in double digits on a daily basis"

If they won’t be driving I think you need to drop the idea of the Skelligs - they could get a coach or train from Dublin to a hub like Galway, Killarney or Cork, and book day drips or hire a car there to see some sights, but being dependent on public transport to get out to somewhere like Portmagee, makes the logistics too difficult imo at least in the context of a short trip."

Google search skellig landing tour; several companies run boats. All well rated so I’m not sure which one stands out more than another. We’re actually going 5/21 with  Sea Quest ([Skellig Rock Cruises](https://www.skelligsrock.com)) since they were the company that took out the cast and crew from Star Wars.

But public transport isn’t handy to Portmagee. And you need to be there by 8 am the morning of if it departs on time. It’s an hour and a half to get there according to Google and most people recommend that you add 20% to that so at least 1 hr 40 minutes. Most public transport won’t run that early so my recommendation is get to Portmagee the day before in their case (even if they get their own car too, especially if they’re not early morning people)

If it does get cancelled the morning of, the tour company may still do the eco tour (just boat around the island). But there is also lots to do in that area too; check out one of my recent posts here. A lot of people gave great suggestions on it for alternatives to skellig if it gets cancelled"

We are traveling to Ireland with a medium sized group for my sister-in-law’s 30th birthday in April (19-27). We are going to be in Dublin(19-21), Cork(21-22), Dingle(22-24), Galway(24-26), and end again in Dublin(26-27).

Hoping to make public transit work for transport (if we can get the leg between Dingle and Galway to work…looking into a few tour options to take us from one spot to the other with a stop at the Cliffs of Moher)

I would love to hear advice on unique experiences in these places. Input on the typical tourist to-dos is also welcome but I’d love to especially hear about the slightly off the beaten path experiences you’ve had in these locations. We are a group of 6-8 that is down to try about anything.

Additionally, I love to take home souvenirs from trips that are very true to the place I’ve visited. Any recommendations for places to stop in at? I’ve seen so far Claddagh rings in Galway and I remember seeing a few things about wool items.

EDIT:

Would also LOVE recommendations for vintage stores in any of the cities we are stopping in. Another favorite way to bring home memories from a trip for me :-) ","Just did a week roadtrip hitting all the same spots!

We found that car hire was super affordable and well worth it. I didn't look into public transport between the areas but I feel like you will have a better experience for off the beaten path activities if you can drive.

For example you can stop on the way from Dublin to Cork at the Rock of Cashel or Kilkenny and there are a lot of super easy day trips from Cork (30 mins to 1 hour one way) that might be difficult without a car. We did Cobh and Kinsale but there is also a distillery in Midleton.

Between Cork and Dingle I'd recommend Killarney. It was raining when passed through but Muckross Abbey and House might be interesting as a group.

Looks like you will have a bit of time in Dublin which is totally fine because there is lots to do but if you're looking for an outdoorsy day coast walk from Greystones to Bray was great. Train from Dublin of course.

Slea Head Drive in Dingle is also a must!"

Don't buy your souvenirs there as they are cheap and can be bought in any gift store or online. With taking public transport it's very unreliable and if you call a smaller bus operator they would likely price out doing the full tour for you and the experience would be much better and most of the time comes with stories and local knowledge. PM me and I'll recommend some companies that I would hire or at least price. You could do the ring of Kerry if you got a minibus too"

You can view stats for individual train routes here https://www.irishrail.ie/en-ie/about-us/train-punctuality-reliability-performance and most train routes offer opportunities to see scenic views though generally the Midlands (which you can’t avoid en route from Dublin to the West or South coast) are a bit less interesting. It’s also a nice way to chat to locals who are fellow travellers.

Some local rural buses can be a little hit and miss in places but the intercity routes tend to be mostly ok in my experience.

I mean I wouldn’t tack a time sensitive international flight onto the end of them but worst case you’re normally only delayed by 20 mins or so which probably isn’t going to ruin your holiday. 

To get from Dingle to Galway is a bit messy to be honest using public transport. Better off visiting Dingle by bus on a different day and then leaving from Killarney instead (Killarney is served by train from Dublin) and getting the train from Killarney to Ennis. The Cliffs of Moher bus with Bus Eireann goes from Ennis to Galway via a very scenic route thru the Burren and stops at Cliffs, Doolin etc.

Ireland worth visiting over New Years?,"I was send here by the mods of r/AskIreland and hope some of you can answer me some questions and/or give me some recommendations. (: Excuse my english, I'm not a native speaker, sadly I do not speak any geaelic neither, will that be a problem for the overall experience?  
  
I feel a bit lost in my life rn and thought to myself: hey, a short vacation might help to relax and find some downtime to think!  
  
I have some vacation days between 30th december till 7th january and I'd really like to see some of your beautiful country.  
  
I was thinking about staying some days in Dublin over New Years and then either rent a car or take the public transportation to the countryside, but I have some questions I'd be really happy if some of you might help me answer.  
  
How is the public transportation in Ireland, will I get almost anywhere in a decent time and price or does it make sense to rent a car? If so, do you recommend any rental services over others and what would be the price range per day?  
  
In Dublin ofc I'd like to see some of the main touristic sights, I wont ask much about them, but can you recommend anything besides that? Markets, pubs, etc. that are not full of tourists, I'd rather meet friendly local people, if they are friendly? Do people rather dislike tourists and foreigners or are they happy to meet some, if they dont behave like total cumstains? Any areas that are cool to see, any museums, theatres, places you recommend? I'm very interested in history, classic art and culture.  
  
Will there be a lot of action during the holidays, or is everyone with their families and shops, pubs, etc. are mostly closed? And any recommendation for a friendly pub where a lonesome foreigner can spend New Years Eve without being looked at like a weird figure? Any places you recommend to meet some cool people to hang out for a few days, while I'd be in Dublin?  
  
Any (cheap) places to stay you can recommend? I dont need much, but I'd prefer my own room with my own bed over a six bed hostel room, I'm not exactly a backpacker.  
  
For the week after New Years I'd love to travel the countryside, see some cool nature, stay in some relaxed villages, with some friendly locals, a few sheep, an inn or an pub, especially if they might have a room to rent, so I can stay each night somewhere else and walk around in the nature a bit. Idk, any must sees or anyone from a superb village they can recommend to stay awhile and enjoy some traditional irish food? I dont need parties or anything special, just some calm and relaxation is what i need. Eat, drink, sleep, read, write, walk around, you get the gist? Smth smth pittoresque. Whats your must-sees?  
  
I'd be so thankful for any tips and help! I hope you could understand everything I said, again, I'm not a native speaker, so there may be some mistakes here and there. (:","Hello. Go to Dingle Co Kerry for an excellent New Year experience. It has featured on the top ten places to be worldwide on New Year’s Day and will provide you with an experience that represents authentic Ireland more than getting pissed in a sweat box in Dublin and feeling like a drunk sardine stuck in a tin of drunk sardines. You don’t need to know Irish at all as, sadly, it’s a dead language spoken only in pockets of Ireland. Dingle is one if says pockets but even among the locals few of them actually speak Irish. Cillian Murphy (Oppenheimer) and Aiden Gillen (Littlefinger from Gane of Thrones) regularly holiday down there. There is rugged country and great traditional music. Food options are also extremely good and varied down there. Dublin is fine for a short stay but it’s expensive in terms of accommodation and the homeless issue is really a blight on the city at this point. You can fly to Kerry airport and get a bus from there. There are several good options for accommodation in Dingle and there are great options for things to do both on land and at sea. Hellboy 2: The Golden Army and the recent Star Wars films were filmed down there and since they’re heavily dependent on tourism they’re generally only too happy to welcome tourists. Public transport is good and cheap although times can be limited depending on days and the services are a bit more irregular than in other European countries. On New Years people congregate on the bridge for the countdown and right next to the bridge is the pub where everyone fills into late at night. The droichead beag. Literally means little bridge. Also Dick Macks (across from the church) and Foxy Johns are good bets for a drink earlier in the day. People are friendly there and the locals will likely see you as exotic. You’ll be totally fine, have good fun, eat and drink we’ll and hopefully get lucky for yourself."

(:","Jesus no, honestly really not worth it. Go somewhere warm, drink cocktails, stock up on vitamin D and warm the bones. Ireland in winter is cold, dark and miserable it's not much better in the summer, but winter, no. Also it's a greedy country, everything is overpriced for what you get and just not value for money.


But just on your asks 


> I do not speak any geaelic neither, will that be a problem for the overall experience?


No we speak English, you should know that with a quick Google search 


>How is the public transportation in Ireland, will I get almost anywhere in a decent time and price or does it make sense to rent a car? If so, do you recommend any rental services over others and what would be the price range per day?


Public transport is shite in the cities and practically non existent outside of cities 


> that are not full of tourists


Literally not going to happen, it's the holiday season and you're not the only one thinking of a short break, considering Ireland is now the only English speaking country in Europe its lead to a huge influx of not only tourist but people moving here.


, I'd rather meet friendly local people, if they are friendly? Do people rather dislike tourists and foreigners or are they happy to meet some, if they dont behave like total cumstains? Any areas that are cool to see, any museums, theatres, places you recommend? I'm very interested in history, classic art and culture.


Friendly and civil but don't expect to make friends. Lots of museums same as every other capital city. 


>Will there be a lot of action during the holidays, or is everyone with their families and shops, pubs, etc. are mostly closed? And any recommendation for a friendly pub where a lonesome foreigner can spend New Years Eve without being looked at like a weird figure? Any places you recommend to meet some cool people to hang out for a few days, while I'd be in Dublin?


Action? It's holiday season it'll be busy with revellers and tourists. Pubs will be jammers on new years eve the same as any other pub the world over. As I've said everyone will be civil and polite I don't know what else you're expecting? Life long friends, no , not even those who moved here can manage that. 


>Any (cheap) places to stay you can recommend? I dont need much, but I'd prefer my own room with my own bed over a six bed hostel room, I'm not exactly a backpacker.


No cheap accommodation in Ireland if you haven't booked anywhere by now, I'd get cracking, accommodation is scarce and expensive, that's just how it is. Booking.com will show you that

It really depends on where in the country you want to go, at this time of year sunset is 4.30pm and with the rain, fog, possible snow or sleet you'll really not see much. I honestly can't be more positive, it's shite here at the best of times but winter is long, freezing, bleak and depressing."

The weather will be bad, but you sound prepared for it. If you are wanting to go to small villages you are best to rent a car for a few days, like some people have already said unless you are in a city the public transport is sparse. With cork and Kerry you'll get the wild Atlantic way and even though the weather isn't great it is actually really nice this time of year. Hope that helps with your plans."

It said something like, the weather may be bad, museums etc closed & poor public transport.
Weather can be very damp & cold.
You got good advice re Dingle, a popular tourist town. 
Accommodation is scarce & should be booked in advance, all over Ireland.

I'd be more inclined to go to Canaries or somewhere for some winter sun.

Enjoy yourself what ever you do."

"Visiting where our ancestors were born, looking for a scenic train journey and a scenic drive","My family is planning a trip to Ireland this coming fall. We're Americans of Irish descent and as our mother hits her 70s, she wants to see Polshask Cross near Williamstown, County Galway, where our ancestors (specifically her grandmother) were born.

We're staying for ten days, so we have time to visit a few different areas (In addition to Williamstown, we were going to spend time in Dublin, Belfast, and Dingle). 

I'm in charge of transportation, and would love to rent a car for some trips and take the train for the rest (I'm an American who loves train journeys, it's my cross to bear with our terrible public transportation). I wanted to know if there is a particularly scenic train journey or drive that we could take on/across the island, the longer the better.

Thank you so much in advance, and I hope you all have a great day!","Most significant rail lines in the Repubic of Ireland from a railfan perspective (personal opinion here): The Western Rail corridor (Galway to Limerick), Limerick Junction--Waterford line, and the Limerick-Ballybrophy line. The last two are partially single tracked and staffs are used to control the traffic.

In Northern Ireland, the line between Belfast and Derry is world famous for it's views along the rocky coast.

As you are close to Galway, you can do a circle trip (weekdays only): Leave Galway on the 11:05 train to Dublin. At Portarlington, change for the train to Cork--you'll arrive in Ballybrophy at 2:57 pm, and this is where the interesting ride starts. Catch the 4:36 pm train to Limerick (runs over the Limerick-Ballyrophy branch and arrives in Limerick at 5:45 pm). From Limerick, catch the 6:05 pm train to Galway (runs direct, over the Western Rail Corridor line). Should arrive back in Galway at 8:33 pm."

You can get the train from Dublin to Galway and Belfast easy enough op. Dingle is a little trickier. Not to be ageist but that’s a lot of ground to cover is she up for it? You’ll definitely need a car for that part of Galway. Ireland had an amazing rail network and was almost all torn up when the car arrived. (By order of Ryan tubridys grandad if you want to go down a wiki rabbit hole) 

If you’re in Dublin you may as well go to Wicklow for a day. That’s the real Ireland you see on the postcards. Mountains and ancient churches and historic sites.

Cliffs of Moher guidence,"I have been going back and forth with my Irish leg on my upcoming trip to Europe and think I would like to get some advice from some locals. 

I will be in Ireland from May 10th-May 13th (although I have an extra day I can use if I need to)

I will be arriving in Ireland through Amsterdam and plan to land in Dublin. 

My plan is once I get to dublin, take bus/train to Ennis/Limerick/Doolin or wherever and get a room for the night, or do the cliffs that day and get a room for the night and leave the next day.

I have seen it posted that the cliffs are SUPER busy in summer months and it may make more sense to just hire a tourbus that way I don't have to use public transportation that is over crowded.

Do you think that is the way to go? There are a few Irish Tour bouses that leave from Dublin take you along the country side all the way to the Cliffs. 

This makes a lot of sense since I will be arriving and leaving through Dublin (i also plan to spend two days in Dublin and go check out the Jameson and Guiness brewery)

So what do you guys think makes the most sense? Take a day bus ride from Dublin, see the cliffs and a couple cities and end up back in Dublin that night?

Or take a public transit bus from Dublin to Doolin, spend the night in Doolin, see the cliffs and city then bus back to Dublin?","The tour buses are not actually the official public transport, they are usually run by private companies. The state bus company is Bus Éireann, [www.buseireann.ie](https://www.buseireann.ie). 

But why do you want to go all that way for just the Cliffs of Moher? There's no guarantee you'll even see anything, Irish weather is notoriously unpredictable. I would either go directly to County Clare and enjoy it there for the 3 days, or just spend the 3 days in Dublin."
Cliffs of Moher guidence,"I have been going back and forth with my Irish leg on my upcoming trip to Europe and think I would like to get some advice from some locals. 

I will be in Ireland from May 10th-May 13th (although I have an extra day I can use if I need to)

I will be arriving in Ireland through Amsterdam and plan to land in Dublin. 

My plan is once I get to dublin, take bus/train to Ennis/Limerick/Doolin or wherever and get a room for the night, or do the cliffs that day and get a room for the night and leave the next day.

I have seen it posted that the cliffs are SUPER busy in summer months and it may make more sense to just hire a tourbus that way I don't have to use public transportation that is over crowded.

Do you think that is the way to go? There are a few Irish Tour bouses that leave from Dublin take you along the country side all the way to the Cliffs.

If you rely on public transport you will find it very limiting trying to get a bus to the places in Clare that you mention. If you really wanted to see them I think you should take a look at the tourist buses like Paddywagon. They tend to do the main tourist things in one trip. 

Arriving at Dublin airport you will either have to take a bus or taxi to the city centre. The bus could take an hour. You'll then have to take a train to Galway or Limerick, that's another couple of hours, possibly a minimum 1 hour wait for the train. Then in Limerick you will have to get a bus to Ennis to catch a connecting bus to the Cliffs or Doolin. It will take you a minimum of 45 minutes to get to Ennis. I don't know how long it takes from Ennis to the Cliffs/Doolin.  You would spend a lot of time traveling."

 As other posters have noted the Aran Island ferry (Google Doolin ferry) will give you a nice view from the ocean though your itinerary is very tight to squeeze in enough time to explore the memorable Islands.

Another option would be early train to Galway from Dublin pick up the Cliffs of Moher bus service (run by the state bus company Bus Éireann not a private tour operator) to Co
Clare but (assuming you’re reasonably active and able bodied) hop out in Doolin and do the cliff walk from there to the Cliffs which is lovely and imho gives better views and will be a lot less crowded than the visitor centre. Doolin is an awesome place to overnight one of the prime
locations to hear authentic Irish traditional music in local pubs) so pick up the bus (or pre arrange a cab) to pick you up in the Cliffs visitor centre back to Doolin then next morning reverse the journey back to Galway and Dublin. An added bonus is that bus route also brings you through the Burren. So are the Cliffs worth 1.5 days of your time out of a 3 day visit, I’d say probably not but if you see the Burren and spend a night in Doolin it makes a little more sense and gives more value.

Info on the cliff walk here https://www.cliffsofmoher.ie/your-visit/beyond-the-cliffs-places-to-see/cliffs-of-moher-coastal-walk/

The problem with tour buses is they only go to and from the visitor centre which can be very crowded and it’s not the optimal viewing position for the them. 

You should be ok with booking trains a few days before hand at www.irishrail.ie however that particular bus might be a bit busier (others may have more specific knowledge here) but I definitely wouldn’t leave it to the last minute.

Public transport in Ireland is cheap, comfortable (especially the trains) and a super way to travel… trains generally fast but buses a little slower and anyway Doolin/Cliffs are only served by buses.

How to pick?! Only 3 days in March,"It will be my boyfriend and my first time to Ireland. We only have 3.5 days in Ireland in early/mid March. We’ve been planning on staying in Dublin the entire time and doing a day trip to cliffs of moher (it stops in Galway for like, an hour as well) using a tour, but I’m having doubts. We both really want to see more of the countryside, but we won’t be renting a car. And obviously nobody can predict the weather but I’m concerned that we’ll dedicate an entire third of our trip to see the cliffs and we might not be able to see much if it’s too rainy. I know we’re so limited on time, and maybe we should just commit to Dublin and save the rest for another trip. We’re doing London and Edinburgh on this trip, so I’m worried we’ll be city-ed out as Ireland is our last stop. Am I overthinking this? For reference, we like to see castles, outdoor stuff, eat, and drink lol

Edited to add, our flight home leaves from Dublin but we haven’t booked transportation arriving into Ireland, and the hotel we booked in Dublin is refundable ","Lots of nice stuff to do in Dublin that doesn't all involve staying in the city, and much of it is accessible by public transport. Malahide Castle and gardens, Ardgillan Castle, Kilmainham Gaol, War Memorial Gardens, Collins Barracks to name a few (some are city centre but not all)
Previous poster had some great ideas for day trips outside Dublin too, a lot of them less than an hour away. Stick to Dublin or in such a short stay you'll end up wrecked and won't enjoy it."
Visiting from Canada,"Hi everyone! My friend and I will be visiting Ireland next June. We’ll be attending the Taylor Swift concert in Dublin. None of us have gone to Ireland before so I thought I could get some advice/suggestions here. 

We’re planning on staying in Dublin for a couple of days but would love to see the rest of Ireland OR travel to other countries nearby! We both work as nurses so we don’t have a lot of vacation time due to our seniority levels so we only have a max of 7 days off. 

Here are some of our questions:

- How is public transportation like within Dublin and from Dublin to other parts of Ireland? (We will not be renting a car)

- Where is somewhere besides Dublin that is easy to get too and that we can stay for a couple of days? (Can be around Ireland or a different country nearby) 

- What are some must-see’s/must-try’s in Dublin? 

- Is there anything else we should know about traveling around Ireland? 

Thanks so much in advance!

EDIT: I HAVE DONE SOME RESEARCH ALREADY BUT WANTED FRESH SUGGESTIONS/ADVICE - That is why this post is probably repetitive to most. Sorry if that bothers anyone.","Try to book your accommodation for the night of the Taylor Swift concert as soon as possible. Unfortunately hotel prices skyrocket whenever there is a gig on you may find it tough to get decent prices there. It may be worthwhile looking at a hotel further out where you can get public transport to the gig. B&B's may be slightly cheaper but not all are online so you might need to ring a few to find availability. 

With 7 days, you have plenty of time to see areas other than Dublin. While public transport isn't as great as other parts of Europe, you will be able to get to larger towns and cities via bus or train. Transport for Ireland is a good website to check out how to get to different destinations. 

As for where to go, you'll find tons of suggestions in this sub, but an idea of what you're interested in doing will help narrow down suggestions. It's absolutely possible to fly to another country in the 7 days you have. Ryanair is a low cost airline that serves a lot of Europe. Just beware that it could mean spending a lot of your holiday in airports so unless you have a burning desire to see another country, there will be plenty to entertain you here!"

Travel help needed for first trip to Ireland this May,"This is my first time leaving the US and am traveling to Ireland this may with 2 other friends and we are in our mid 20’s. I’m looking for travel advise on must sees  and transport as we are only in country for a week.

I’m really hoping for suggestions, we are very open to changes. Please help! Our first main concern is transport. We were looking to rent vehicles, but majority are standards not automatic and none of us are good enough at driving stick to be comfortable with it. How feasible is taking the train and is there any better form of transport?

Right now we are looking primarily at Airbnb’s for stays. Our plan so far is first night in (flying into) Dublin, 2 nights in Galway, a night in Cork, and then 2 more nights in Dublin (fly out).

We are looking to do the following

-Killarney National Park
-blarney Stone
-Guinness brewery
-jameson distillery 
-Smithwicks brewery
-Kilkenny Castle
-visit limerick
-galway castles
-visit Monaghan and Armagh

You’re going to have a great time! Galway and Limerick are great, as well as accommodation in AirBNBs if that is the route you want to go.

There are a couple things you should know:

- if you are under 25, so you will have a hard time renting cars in Ireland- most rental places require you to be at least 25. 

- you’re going to pay a premium if you do find a place to rent to you, and a premium for automatics. So be prepared for this. It could easily increase the cost of your rental by 50% or even double it.

- I personally recommend Costco for the rental. They require you to be 25, but there are no hidden charges. You can also try Eurocar.

- get the smallest car you can manage to fit your luggage in. DONT get an SUV. Roads can be narrow in Ireland, and even in the city, with cars parked on each side, it’s though to navigate. Lots of lost mirrors and damaged quarter panels. 

- the cost of additional insurance can double the cost of your rental. Best to arrange insurance outside of your rental company, but make sure they accept it. We use the credit card insurance- BUT CALL the CC  implant and get a letter ensuring you are specifically covers for Ireland. Ask them about what’s covered.

- note if you manage to do the above, companies like Budget or Hertz or Enterprise can take a CRAZY deposit since you aren’t using their insurance.my largest deposit was €5,000! (The refunded it at car return, but (!))

- THE ABOVE being said, it may be better for you to skip the rental and take busses, trains and public transport around Ireland. Perfectly doable, but takes time.

- use Google Maps or Rome2Rio to route plan.

- I take the train from Galway to Dublin and back 2X a week. It’s fine. You can take busses to most places for like €15 if you want to go to other cities. I prefer trains for the view though.

- DONT RENT A CAR IN DUBLIN. It’s a waste. Traffic sucks. Walk, bus or bike. Seriously."

Pre book your tickets online for the best price more than an hour before. At the station is more $$.

There’s Wi-Fi, but no food services currently on board.  Bring food  or snacks for the journey. Pre-book and choose your seats together at a table.

The train is fine. Several trains each direction leaving almost every 1.5-2 hours. Cost 1-way is between €11-15. You may be able to get a student rate, but you have to check as the verification/requirements for student have changed. Recommend getting a “Leap” card which you can purchase at the train station kiosks for busses for around the city as well.


But, note that you may prefer a bus (such as Eir Eagle or GoBuS) if you are cling straight from the Airport to Galway. As this is quickest way to get on the road and out of the city- as the buses to Galway are usually direct.  They’re nice, but not my preferred method unless I have an odd schedule or just need to get there.

If i remember  correctly, there is a not a good bus to get from Dublin Airport to Heuston station where the train is. 

But, if you plan to run around Dublin City first, no worries then take a bus into town (40 minutes) and then run around town. Get the train when you are headed out to Galway."

Wheelchair accessibility,"We are planning our trip to Ireland next year and my Mother-in-law got invited somehow. She issues a mobility aid for long days such as traveling. 
I’d love to know how accessible public transportation is; tram, taxis, Ubers, buses from Dublin to other cities. 
Please help!","The general city scape in Dublin isn't great for accessibility. Expect lots of narrow pavements and in places there are uneven surfaces. In general most pedestrian crossings have dropped curbs.

Modern buildings have decent accessibility but a lot of our most popular museums and attractions are based out of older buildings that wouldn't be quite as accessible.

Public transport isn't the worst. Most forms of public transport can be boarded in a wheelchair. On busses may need to ask the driver for assistance and on the train line you can ask staff at the station for assistance and they will call ahead to your destination station to give notice. Certain stations are notorious for having permanently out of order lifts so you may need to help her up and down the station stairs at times.

The percentage of the taxi fleet set up for wheelchairs is low enough, so you will generally have to book in advance to secure wheelchair accessible taxi. Private hire doesn't really exist here, so Uber is just a  booking app for standard taxis. Freenow is more widely used for taxi booking than Uber."

Def be much handier for buses and trains as our trains don't have ramps so you've to wait for them to bring a ramp and only 1 wheelchair can fit on a bus so if she can walk to a seat and fold the chair you'll def have more options.

Please help!","Just for clarity: Mobility scooter is a no go because...

Coaches - if you can find one that's accessible, may only be able to take one wheelchair, and it way not included a scooter which is bigger than a fully motorised chair.

Oh, and in case it's relevant. Coach buses here tend not to have the toilets open, at all. So that might need to be considered.

Local Buses - would probably be the least issue but only one WC space per bus and if in use already, you have to wait for next one, in whatever weather.

Taxi's - getting a full size taxi with ramps etc to get a motorised WC in and out takes lots of planning and booking ahead, there really aren't many in the whole city, and again, not sure they can actually take a scooter (probably can). And, they don't have much room for other people, so every trip would be 2 taxis every time.

Trains - The trains themselves aren't the problem here, it's the stations... and this will apply even if she can walk a bit. Specifically it's if the ramps are needed getting on and off trains, that requires enquiring ahead of time and then, the lifts. So many stations consistently have the accessibility lifts out of order meaning you've to somehow get her and WC or Scooter up and down a large set of steps, either inbound or outbound (or, both). It's a gamble as to whether you can get out of a station if you've been able to get off the train in the first place. (I follow a couple of WC using people on twitter and this is by far the biggest issue in public transport here).

As the other user has mentioned the narrower paths with uneven surface, that's very relevant for urban areas. Strides are constantly being made for tourist attractions but some places there is only so much that can be done. Websites should detail the accessibility there is or isn't, so a bit of research will go a long way. 

I was about to say just rent a car but tbh, a folding WC takes up so much room in a boot, you'd need an estate just to be able to fit luggage as well. 

It can of course be done, it'll just takes some thinking about"

Planning a 11 day trip to Ireland and need help/advice in where to go on my last 5 days of my trip. I already booked my stays for Galway and Cork (could adjust if needed). I am not renting a car, so relying on public transport. Would love to see the mountains and hike if possible - this is a present to myself to celebrate being cancer free.  Thanks in advance for the help! 


Day 1 - land in Dublin & sight see 

Day 2-5 - Galway 

Days 5-7 - Cork","Killarney national park is fantastic I would recommend there, if you are into castles and the more historical side of things bunratty castle is also brilliant. If you are planning to head back over near Leinster at all I would recommend Meath. They have places like newgrange (ancient burial tomb that predates the pyramids) and the hill of Tara, they also have Trim castle which I personally love. Lots of great history in the Meath area! Glendalough is located in the Wicklow mountains and is also super stunning you can hike or go more relaxed trails and the views are out of this world. 

Congratulations on being cancer free also!"

Thank you in advance for your answers! I'm looking to travel to Ireland the first two weeks of July and I'm a little stuck.

I'm a great driver but I have not driven on the other side of the street and don't want to risk anyone else's life that's not how I do things.

That being said I know the island is drivable in half a day, would stay in Dublin for those 2 weeks and just adventuring out be a good plan or are there other options?

If you do want get a car, look into day rentals. Especially with a pick up on the edge of town. 
The driving was pretty easy to adjust to, the most challenging part for me was in small towns and villages. The narrow streets and pedestrians just walking out in front of you meant that you had to be alert, constantly. 
Dublin was fun, but I would recommend staying in other places. Some of the excursions, whether you drive yourself or book tours, make for long days in a vehicle.

But then again, I get a bit testy if I have to stop and start a lot for traffic lights. 

It's honestly not that hard to switch from one side to the other, especially if you're driving an automatic car - which you should book as soon as possible as they are NOT the default here. 

I don't know what you mean by 'the island is drivable in half a day' but I suspect you might have been misinformed. Aside from the few stretches of motorway, roads in Ireland are NOT built for large volumes of high-speed traffic, you will NOT be driving 100 miles in 100 minutes on them. In addition to other cars, you will very likely come across coaches, trucks, caravans, campervans, tractors, farm machinery like combine harvesters and trailers, construction machinery, cyclists, walkers, even farm animals like cattle, sheep and horses. 

All over Ireland are towns and villages, and quite honestly, THESE are the beating heart of the country. All of them have tourist accommodation of some sort either in the towns themselves, or close by - hostels, Bed & Breakfasts, hotels, Farmhouse Stays, campsites, caravan parks. All you have to do is pick a town - say Lisdoonvarna in County Clare, and simply Google Lisdoonvarna+hotel or Lisdoonvarna+accommodation, and something will come up. WAY BETTER to leave Dublin and drive to these places and stay there. In summer especially there'll be plenty to see and do and enough places to eat. 

We do have a public transportation system as well - buses mainly for rural areas in the west - and this can be accessed via [www.transportforireland.ie](https://www.transportforireland.ie). As July is the high season in tourism, there will be more services on then. 

Staying in Dublin and driving out every day is, frankly, insane. Not to mention expensive and exhausting. Pick up your rental car when you leave, bring it back when you arrive in Dublin, don't bother with it in the city, it's more a liability than a help there."

Driving back to Dublin each day would be insane.
What I don’t think anyone has mentioned is that driving from Dublin to Cork, Belfast, Galway you’ll be on motorways so you don’t really feel that you’re on the wrong side of the road as much.

You can cover a lot of ground to get between the main cities in a few hours but all the good stuff (Kerry, West Cork, Clare, North Antrim (Giants)) is an hour or two past where the motorway ends. So Dublin say Dingle is probably a 10 hour round trip.

Do consider Public trains and buses and a few well chosen local day tours- trains in particular are fast, cheap and really comfortable"
Yet another Itinerary,"Coming to Ireland in April and I have an itinerary. Staying at a hotel in Dublin, I can’t drive, so renting a car is out so it’s basically. 

Day 1/2- Dublin, seeing the city, eating the food, drinking the whiskey. 

Day 3- Boyne Valley Tour for Hill of Tara and Newgrange. 

Day 4- Day Trip tour to Cliffs of Moher

Day 5- Rathcroghan to give my respects to the Morrigan. (Need to figure out how to get here since I can’t find any day tours) 

Day 6- Belfast/Goants Causeway day trip tour. 

Day 7- Wicklow to visit the Olde Shillelagh Shop. (Also need to figure out transport there). 

Day 8- Relaxing and enjoying my last day

Day 9- Fly home.

Any tips or suggestions? ","Rathcroghan is unreachable by public transport, especially coming from Dublin. Your best bet is the train to Roscommon and a taxi up to Rathcroghan. Shillelagh you should be able to do this by taking the train to Carlow and then the bus heading towards Arklow stops along the way at Shillelagh.

The Giant's Causeway and Cliffs of Moher are way too far away from Dublin for the day, you'll spend most of your time stuck on a bus, but if they're a must for you and you don't mind the bus, go for it. 

If you want to get out of Dublin City Centre, but still stay close by, maybe try the Dublin Coastal Trail, very reachable by bus or train. Dún Laoghaire's seafront is beaut!"

Finally visiting! <3 Various inquiries :3,"Hi all! I will be visiting Ireland for the first time next month. I am still searching accommodations in Dublin, arriving early Tuesday morning 14th of November and staying through that Friday night. So far I've found Agibail's Hostel for female dorms which seem nice but if there are any other women-only places to stay, please send your recommendations 🙂

  
I am very much looking forward to all the public transportation 😍 And as of right now, I may very well end up taking a train or multiple trains each day that I am there (I am overwhelmed, looking at the train routes/tickets 🤯 it seems you can cover a lot of ground (a lot of Ireland!) in no time at all and for very reasonable fare. 

  
So far, I've found a private, guided tour of IRA history in Belfast that looks to be very informative. I'm very interested in such things if anyone can offer further recommendations (IRA; other, perhaps lesser known, resistance movements/parties - past and present). 

Also, while in Belfast, I would love to find out more about my great-great grandmother and her family; I only have her maiden name and per her birth record, ""born 1891 in Northern Ireland"". Are there any archives open to the public? Where could I go in Belfast or surrounding areas to track down such a thing? 

  
I've also been reading about An Súgán Museum of the Irish language and Gaelic Revival - but I dont think they've opened yet? Any similar points of interests are welcome (history of Gaelic language or even classes open to the public) 🙏 

  
Art museum recommendations please! 🎨💚

  
I will be checking in with IPSC for events 🇮🇪 🇵🇸 but if anyone has info on similar organizations so that I may stay abreast of marches/rallies/etc., I appreciate it 🤝

  
That's all I can think of for now! :3","Just on the gallery bit: in Dublin you’ve three (no! Four. See addendum) real gems you mustn’t miss. All free entry. 

First, the National Gallery is an utter treasure box. A really charming building, with a collection that’s small by international standards but which includes many *perfect* paintings that will lift your heart. (I think our Vermeer is one of the artist’s greatest works, for instance, and our Caravaggio has a thrilling history in  Ireland) 
Across the city there’s Dublin City Gallery, known to us as the Hugh Lane Gallery, which takes up the baton of art history where the National Gallery’s collection ends, and moves into the 20th century. Some items and installations there that are essential viewing. (There’s also a first class restaurant, if you fancy an excellent supper.) 

Out a small distance to Heuston railway station there’s IMMA: the Irish Museum of Modern Art at the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham. Housed adjacent to Kilmainham Gaol as the gallery is, you’ll be on intensely hallowed ground connected with the Easter Rising. 
(Edited to disentangle my information)


These three galleries are the state’s principal galleries, but of course Dublin also has umpteen independent galleries dotted throughout the city. Strolling around the city you’ll see many public sculptures, most of which will have been traditionally rechristened  by some local wit. Buildings too: I could meander around Dublin for days just ogling the architecture. 

(Edit: I forgot to mention the Chester Beatty Library, which holds a collection of Eastern art and also crafts. A heavenly place and a gorgeous collection.)

Elsewhere in Ireland you’ll find more excellent public galleries, some meriting a visit even just for the architecture. Churches too are worth considering, if you’re an admirer of stained glass, especially. Much depends on your itinerary, of course. (For example in West Cork you’d have to investigate James Turrell’s stupendous Sky Garden)"

The rain situation is this: It might rain, or it might not. You won't know for sure until it does. Wear a rain jacket and waterproof shoes. Sorted. 

You're not seriously considering going out and back to all these places every time from Dublin? Huge waste of time and money. Just find a place to stay in ... Belfast and Mayo and maybe one place in between to access the Stairway to Heaven - not sure how you'd get there with public transport, to be honest, but maybe someone local from that area will be able to chime in and advise. If you know the town in Mayo where your forebears are from, try staying there. The public transport website for the Republic of Ireland is [www.transportforIreland.ie](https://www.transportforIreland.ie) and there's a different one for Northern Ireland, again am expecting someone local to chime in with that info. (I live in the south-west so am not very familiar with regions north of Galway.) 

Places that are very easy to get to from Dublin are Howth and Wicklow. You can stay in Dublin for those, and use the DART to get to them. Buy a Leap card for Dublin. Kilkenny city you can get to by train from Heuston Station, it's maybe 90 minutes away, but I'm not sure about the caves. As for Blarney, why? Why would you made a MASSIVE detour all the way down to Cork just for that? Not worth it. 

The fact that some of us could see the Northern Lights at all from Ireland was a huge anomaly and very very rare. Normally we don't see them at all."

Minivan rental?,"Trying to find a car rental that would fit my family of 6 but there is a drastic jump in price for vehicles that fit 5 vs 6. Over $1000 difference for a week which seems absurd.

birthday trip to ireland - any recommendations?,"hi all!! im hoping to take a 5-7 day trip to ireland for my 19th birthday as i honestly love the culture/nature and really want to see it in person. this would happen late march/early april 

ive been researching some different places to visit and so far i definitely want to visit donegal, galway, derry and potentially dublin. anyone have any specific recommendations? 

some questions as well - 
1) i personally wont rent a car, how hard would it be to travel around cities like galway and donegal? would you recommend i go on a guided tour as that usually comes with transport too? 
2) im pescatarian and i also don’t drink but completely understand that drinking/meat and alcoholic beverages is in many cultural dishes - is it usually hard to find food that suits this? or should i prepare to buy groceries and cook food up myself? 
3) any particular cities or regions which are the best in terms of nature and medieval architecture? i have a particular interest in castles so would love to see many

i don’t mind splurging on some really fun tasks/hotels/sights so i would appreciate a wide range of recommendations!! 

thank you very very much in advance!!!","Cars are completely superfluous in all Irish cities and towns as Dublin has decent public transport and is walkable and all other towns and cities are much much smaller.

Galway is easy to get to via a train from Dublin which is cheap, fast and comfortable. There’s a fairly comprehensive thread about Irish public transport a few weeks backFor Donegal you’ll need a bus which will be much slower. You should have no problem organising a bus tour of Connemara from Galway City.

You should have no issues with dining- fish is available in most locations and is usually fresh and excellent quality. Very very few dishes incorporate alcohol and your server will guide you if you let them know your preferences.

Any queries just ask."

But buses fill in the gaps and consider buying a €5 3 day pass for the Dublin bike scheme which is a handy way to get around the main sights in the city centre. As you enjoy a pescatarian diet be sure to visit Howth (30 min/€2 train fare from city centre on the Dart) which is a working fishing port with some good fish restaurants and take aways

Renting a car can be an expensive hassle but you are limiting your options if you choose not too. 

If you want to rely on public transport I’d suggest planning  to stay in larger towns like Galway which have better transport links and from where you can plan to do excursions / day trips with various companies to sites like the cliffs or the Aran islands or around Connemara ."

If you use Costco and use a credit card that has insurance, you can book easily through them. You have to present a letter that your CC covers insurance in Ireland when you pick it up to waive their coverage.

They’ll take a substantial deposit, but you get it back. Other than that, pretty easy. Your US license is good for 1 year driving here. I’d rent an automatic if you’re not confident if  your abilities. Don’t get a large car, but something like a Skoda or a Camery will do.

Car is by far the easiest unless you take one of those “Paddy Wagon” tour busses to get to the cliffs. 

You can  use your phone for directions if you plan includes international minutes, or it’s unlocked and you buy a temporary Irish pre-paid sim.


If you take public transport from the airport, I would do an AirCoach or the Train (you have to take a bus to get there). The problem is once you get to a hub (like Galway) you have to get out to Dolan.


Source- have rented dozens of cars as an American here, and now live in Galway.


ALSO- why would you ask about pepper spray? Ireland is one of the safest counties in the EU. Also pepper spray is A: impossible to bring on a flight. B:illegal in Ireland. People don’t mess with Americans, and if you have a “I need weapons to protect myself” mentality, you’re gonna have bad interactions with people."

Why not try a nice peaceful and safe place, like Kabul or Donetsk? 😊 Seriously, as others have said, things are not like you seem to think. Leave the pepper spray at home. Even if you could get it in without anybody seeing it, you would never need it. 

Renting a car is not without problems, but not as bad as you seem to think. If something bad happens, people talk about it, but if everything goes smoothly, they don't. That is why you have heard bad things about car rental.

Renting a car gives you more freedom to go where you want at your own time and pace, but you will have to concentrate a bit on the driving and navigation, leaving you less time to appreciate the journey. Public transport has that advantage. So balance the pros and cons."

Or you could take a Bus to Galway. I take the train from Galway to Dublin weekly- its about $30 round trip. The bus is less, but takes longer, and is less scenic.

Driving gets you the fun option of going to the sites on the way to Doolin. You can see the Burren, Caves and other neat shops along the way. You can go at your own pace. AND if you have time, you can go to the Aran Islands from Dolan.

Word of advice though, I don’t think the Cliff Tours by boat are worth it. Better to see if from the top of the cliffs by running them than by sea. The boat doesn’t get close enough anyway. The Clifs visitors center is kinda lame as well. There some interactive things for kids, but the movie they show there is uninformative.

Go to the Aran islands and rent a bike there for $10 with your family. It’s 100% with it if the weather isn’t bad. Pre-book tickets.

BUT, for you going to Doolin, really the car is yor best option. I guess one other thing you could do is use “Go Car”- but you have to pre-register for it for them to take your license info. Then you rent the car by the hour. Insurance is included, but the kicker is I think it has to be returned the spot you rented it from. GoCar.ie if you want to check.


BUT, regular city busses don’t take credit card. You have to bring exact cash. OR buy a LEAP card from one of the retailers or bus hubs. Check Leapcard.ie for more info.

Living in Galway, relying on busses is cheap, but the trade off is it takes forever to get someplace. The time saving may be worth just taking a taxi for small trips."
Visiting Ireland in 1 month!!! Super excited... but overwhelmed! Could use some pointers from you wonderful experts!,"Hey everyone,

I had been mentally entertaining a trip to Ireland for the past month. Like many others, I played around on google and other feeds to see Irish tourism at its finest. It lured me immediately and I was pumped but didn't immediately commit. I began gathering information about sights to see and things to do. Then... last night... I finally pulled the trigger on my flights. I'm heading over there for 8 days in mid-October and could not be more excited!

However, as this all became more real, I began to do more research into the trip... and found myself very very confused. I've found Ireland's best to be scattered and while the transportation system looks great, it doesn't seem simple to get directly to all the top sights efficiently. On top of that, I feel as though I don't really even know what to see!

We (a couple, approx. 30 y/o) are no strangers to travelling around new and interesting places but this is our first time in Ireland. English is our first language so we should be safe there, but we also know some French if that helps at all :). We love exploring - whether it be natural wonders, city architecture, interesting exhibits/museums/tours/etc, or even food (we love seafood!). Unfortunately, we don't drive manual and also only have experience driving on the right side of the road so we likely won't be getting a rental car :( ... but we do enjoy some biking and hiking!

&#x200B;

**Mentally, here is where I am with the planning:**

**October 9** \- Arrive Dublin Airport in the AM, make our way to the city and drop bags at the hotel near city center Dublin before we go explore Dublin (Trinity College, Guinness Storehouse, explore Downtown, a Museum?, Jamison Whiskey, Pub/Dinner).

\>>>Question for you guys: Since we're staying downtown, do we need to consider transportation around the city or will we be generally ok with walking around?

Also in Dublin or Galway, I was hoping to catch a live Gaelic Football or Hurling match. Any chance my trip plans align with some local games? Cheers!

&#x200B;

**October 10** \- Enjoy a little more Dublin if time permits, otherwise head towards Galway! (I hear the City is fun and there's a ton of attractions nearby)

\>>>Here is where I start to get ABSOLUTELY LOST. I definitely want to do a trip to Cliffs of Moher and possibly the Aran Islands but I don't really know the best way to go about doing these. Would it be best to do a tour? Would it be better to do public transit and go solo? Also, are there other incredible places to visit in and around Galway that are highly recommended for first timers visiting Ireland ready to soak in some castles, geographical formations and landscapes?

&#x200B;

From here on, I believe we want to do the following but get even more lost with our plans:

\>>>Dingle? Killarney? Kerry? Limerick? Cork? Kilkenney? My understanding is that most of our time on the isle should be spent on the western side.

\>>>Skellig? Ring of Kerry? Killarney National Park? Blarney Castle/Stone? Other places I dont even know???

\>>>Make solo plans using public transport? Use any recommended tour services?

There's so much to do and I just feel lost putting my plans together here. Could some kind souls please help sort me out? Thank you so very much!

&#x200B;

**October 16** \- From wherever we are, finally arrive back in Dublin City (likely in the afternoon/evening and enjoy the city once more)

**October 17** \- Depart Dublin Airport in the AM

Thank you for listening to my quick brainmelt as I remain incredibly excited to visit the Emerald Isle! Absolutely cannot wait to be blown away :)","Hi there and thank you so much for your tips! 

For the trains, I heard buying tickets online in advance is the cheapest way to do so. Let me know if I'm right :)

I hadn't heard too much of the Connemara region so I'm definitely excited to do some research on it and possibly add it into our mix! Do you have any specific recommendations you definitely recommend - either castle ruins, or scenic areas, nice towns, etc.

I was doing some research on Doolin recently and found that the trail between Doolin and Cliffs of Moher was currently closed due to safety concerns. Do you still think Doolin is a good bet for this?

In the Dingle peninsula region, I'm not too familiar with it yet - Would you have any recommendations on what to visit and/or whether it is worth grabbing some sort of tour? I assume you mean staying in Dingle for the period of time.

Thanks for the tip on Tralee! Would this allow us to also check out Ring of Kerry somehow? I know we won't have a car but I'm wondering what options may allow us to see the top highlights of the ring (I saw some tours offered for it). Also, other than Ring of Kerry and Killarney National Park, are there any other major items of note that you recommend? Also, what are the best websites for booking B&Bs in Ireland?

Also, if we were to take away a tiny bit of time from the other stops to try a visit to Cork, would that be a fun place to visit? Ive heard wonderful things so I was hoping to stop by on my way back to Dublin.

Unfortunately, we don't drive manual and also only have experience driving on the right side of the road so we likely won't be getting a rental car :( ... but we do enjoy some biking and hiking!

&#x200B;

**Mentally, here is where I am with the planning:**

**October 9** \- Arrive Dublin Airport in the AM, make our way to the city and drop bags at the hotel near city center Dublin before we go explore Dublin (Trinity College, Guinness Storehouse, explore Downtown, a Museum?, Jamison Whiskey, Pub/Dinner).

\>>>Question for you guys: Since we're staying downtown, do we need to consider transportation around the city or will we be generally ok with walking around?

Also in Dublin or Galway, I was hoping to catch a live Gaelic Football or Hurling match. Any chance my trip plans align with some local games? Cheers!

&#x200B;

**October 10** \- Enjoy a little more Dublin if time permits, otherwise head towards Galway! (I hear the City is fun and there's a ton of attractions nearby)

\>>>Here is where I start to get ABSOLUTELY LOST. I definitely want to do a trip to Cliffs of Moher and possibly the Aran Islands but I don't really know the best way to go about doing these. Would it be best to do a tour? Would it be better to do public transit and go solo? Also, are there other incredible places to visit in and around Galway that are highly recommended for first timers visiting Ireland ready to soak in some castles, geographical formations and landscapes?

&#x200B;

From here on, I believe we want to do the following but get even more lost with our plans:

\>>>Dingle? Killarney? Kerry? Limerick? Cork? Kilkenney? My understanding is that most of our time on the isle should be spent on the western side.

\>>>Skellig? Ring of Kerry? Killarney National Park? Blarney Castle/Stone? Other places I dont even know???

\>>>Make solo plans using public transport? Use any recommended tour services?

There's so much to do and I just feel lost putting my plans together here. Could some kind souls please help sort me out? Thank you so very much!

&#x200B;

**October 16** \- From wherever we are, finally arrive back in Dublin City (likely in the afternoon/evening and enjoy the city once more)

**October 17** \- Depart Dublin Airport in the AM

&#x200B;

Thank you for listening to my quick brainmelt as I remain incredibly excited to visit the Emerald Isle! Absolutely cannot wait to be blown away :)",">there are buses that go from Tralee to Killarney). The reason I don't recommend staying in Killarney is because it is one of the biggest tourist hotspots in the country, which means it is also incredibly expensive to stay there. Tralee will cost a fraction of what you would be paying to stay in Killarney. You can also take the train 

Just rent a car from Dublin and return to Dublin at the end - it will make logistics so much easier and rental car prices are cheap right now compared to a year ago. It took me the drive from the airport rental car parking lot to the main road to get used to driving on the left; it's really not that bad and you should give yourself more credit!"
Bikes for Hire with toddler seats in Dublin and/or Derry? Also best playgrounds and parks?,"My family and I (two adults, one toddler) are headed to Ireland in a few weeks and spending some longer stretches of time in Dublin and Derry.

It looks like there might be a Dublin city-wide bike share. Is that true? Any chance they might have bikes that include a way to transport a kid?

Thank you!","I really wouldn’t bike in Dublin with a kid our cycle lanes literally are in the bus lane they’re not safe, there are some areas with nice designated cycle paths such as along the coast from Fairview to Sutton and some other greenways dotted around but really it’s not a cyclist friendly city especially with kids, if you wanted you could do a day of cycling and do the route I mentioned along the coast and stop into St Anne’s park which is really nice and has a good playground, if you go on a Saturday they have food stalls and you could easily spend a few hours there, then you could cycle over to the beach along the causeway"

The bike lanes aren't everywhere and they aren't segregated hardly at all. Dublin is very walkable, a stroller for kid and you'd be safer"

Thank you!","Ashtown Castle in the Phoenix Park has a good playground as well as a cafe and lots of space to run around with a toddler. If you want to do some cycling in a safer environment, the park also has lots of cycle paths that are separated from the main car traffic. There's a place to rent bikes at the main entrance to the park. Dublin Zoo is also in the park and well worth a visit. 

More centrally, Stephens Green and Merion Square parks also both have playgrounds too. 

Not free, but if you have a car, Airfield estate near Dundrum is a great spot for kids with farm animals and playground bits. Slightly further afield but good for kids, have a look at Newgrange farm in Meath and Avondale forest park in Wicklow (the beyond the trees treetop walk has a giant slide and is really cool, plus there's a nice playground by the cafe at the house and lovely woodland walking trails). 

Bray seafront is also a nice place for a day trip with little ones. There's a playground there as well. 

Not far from Derry, Wild Ireland might be of interest."

I don’t know anything about bike rental with toddler seats but narrow roads, few cycle lanes and busy traffic combined with wind and rain make it a tough city for cyclists.

Thank you!","A lot of negative nellys here on the cycling. If you are planning on living in the Dublin suburbs there are loads of lovely cycling routes and gorgeous parks. I don’t know much about hiring bike seats but you could try www.thebikehub.ie they are super enthusiastic about getting people out on bikes and they are situated on a really nice coast bike path in Dun Laoghaire. If you are right in Dublin City centre, it’s honestly too small to cycle around, you are better walking. There are various greenways across the country too, which are mostly completely removed from roads. They usually have bike hire at the start and end, so it’s a nice family day trip. Look up greenways Ireland. I don’t know anything about Derry cycling though."

Thank you!","Salthill Playground in Galway is great. The aquarium isn't free, but we found it worth the cost, especially if you run into a rainy day. Charlie Byrne's Bookshop has a large variety of kids books if that's something your kid enjoys.

In Dublin, Merrion Square playground was our son's favorite. National Gallery of Ireland is right there too with free admission. We popped in because our son needed to use the potty after playground time and he ended up enjoying wandering around the museum aimlessly. St Patrick's Park has a small playground, although my son enjoyed running around the perimeter of the fountain more. If you end up there, consider checking out Marsh's library nearby. Interesting history for the adults and they do a great job engaging children. They've set up Lego figurines around the library and give kids a sheet to check off which ones they've found. Great staff - one of the librarians spent 20 minutes answering my 3 year old's oddball questions. The most random of our finds in Dublin, but the most enjoyable.

Probably a bit out of your way, but depending on how you plan to get from Galway to Derry, there's a great bike path outside Westport. Bike hire with toddler accessories are available. [https://westportbikehire.com/](https://westportbikehire.com/) We were looking into doing this with our toddler, but ended up not being able to plan far enough ahead with unpredictable weather."

We are also used to biking as a family in Philadelphia and other American cities/towns that have little to no bike lanes or biking culture.

Recommendations for trip to Ireland,"I have been thinking about doing a trip to Ireland for YEARS. The time has finally come! I’m planning to come in early September for 14 days.

Any recommendations on must sees/must dos?

I’m a big fan of Irish/Celtic music. So that’s something that I need to do. Pub recommendations?

We will be renting a car so transportation isn’t an issue

TIA! ☺️","Get a rough itinerary ASAP. Do not do what I did and put the bookings to the last minute! It is expensive and accommodations (at least affordable ones) are in short supply.

Even hostels in Dublin are charging $150+ per PERSON in a 6-12 person DORM room!

Ok assuming you follow the above advice. Here is my itinerary for 17 days. It is very FAST and i know a lot of people will criticize me for moving to quickly. I get it. I give the same ""Slow down"" advice to others. But I know me and my family and I know what we want to see and do so we have made a concious decision to move around alot with the understanding that if we want to just chill in a place rather than explore, we will do so.

That being said here is my 17 day itinerary for 4 people with a total cost UNDER $10k US (which to me seems like a LOT of $$$ since my first trip to Europe was almost 3 months and cost less than $3500 US total....man i miss the old days).

**Dublin (2 nights)** \-> Trinity College/Book of Kells, historic walking tour, St. Patricks Cathedral, Christ Church, Guinness Storehouse (overrated, but my we're doing it anyways),  
**Kinsale (1 night)** \-> explore the town, maybe visit Cobh (on way to Kinsale: Rock of Cahel, Hore Abbey, Blarney Castle)  
**Kenmare (1 night)** \-> drive the ring of kerry, Killarney National Park  
**Dingle Peninsula (2 nights)** \-> Drive the peninsula, ferry to Great Blasket, explore Dingle town, find a couple nice pubs and local music sessions  
**Doolin (1 night)** \-> Cliffs of Moher, chill in Doolin  
**Inis Mor (Aran Islands)** (1 night) - Dun Aoghasa, bike the island or horse carriage tour  
**Galway (2 nights)** \-> explore Galway, find some trad music sessions, MAYBE explore the region and go out to Connemarra  
**Westport (2 nights)** \-> explore County Mayo, wifes great grand parents are from this area so might try to find the town they are from before leaving home so MAYBE we can visit that  
**Portrush (Northern Ireland) (2 nights)** \-> base for Antrim Coast exploration: Giant's Causeway, Dunluce Castle, Carrick a Reade rope bridge (for the kids), MAYBE a stop in Londonderry  
**Belfast (2 nights)** \- Black cab murals tour, see the segregation wall and the protestant neighborhoods (MAYBE). Titanic experience, Belfast Castle, a couple local pubs  
**Cabra Castle (1 night)** \-> stay in a castle on our last night.  
NB4: Yes this is SUPER busy. I do not recommend this speed of travel for anyone. I don't even know if it will be good for me and my family and we ALWAYS travel fast to see a lot. But we have limited time and want to see a lot of places because we are not going back anytime soon: so many other countries/places we want to visit before returning somewhere."

We will be renting a car so transportation isn’t an issue

TIA! ☺️","You will be able to do a lot of travel by public transport and visit some places by organised tours. That means you won't need to rent a car for the full holiday. With a little planning, you can reduce the car rental required. For example, if you fly into Dublin and were spending a few days in the city, you would have no need for a car while in the city. After that, from Dublin you can go by road or rail to all parts of the country, so no need for a car on that second leg. Even if you were going to another place in Ireland directly after getting off the plane, you could also do that by public transport. It is only if you want to go off the beaten track or do things in your own time, that you could use a car. Even then, that would probably be only for some of the time. You will be on holidays, so let someone else do the driving.

With two weeks, that gives you a lot of time to see things. You could have a few bases to work from. So stay a few days in Dublin and see the city and do day trips to Newgrange, Glendalough and places like that. Stay a few days in Galway and see Connemara, the Cliffs of Moher, the Aran Islands etc. You could find other bases too. That saves you always being on the move and sleeping in a different place every night and unpacking and packing every day. Settle in places for a few days and see something different in that area, before moving on."

I do like the idea of a car… we were planning on doing an air bnb on the east, west, then north.  And drive to whatever activities we’d wanna do in between. I’m not a big fan of public transportation (lol) 
I’ll look into it tho and see. We do want to do like hikes, and bike ride in inishmore island (a friend of mine did it and said it’s a must!) haha

We were thinking a night or two in Dublin.  I’m not a big fan of the big cities, I really wanna go see castles, little towns, etc.  After Dublin we’d head south and kind of work our way around the country.  I looked up different destinations and everything is relatively close in travel time (I’m from Canada so everything is mad far) 1-2h drive to a location is amazing 😂

Is early September like the tail end of the busy season?.."

You could sit back, relax and enjoy the journey. No worries about navigation, getting used to driving a different car and the other stresses, plus the cost. Get a car for some of the time, yes, but see what you can do by public transport.

September is past the peak of the season here, but it can still be busy. There is still plenty of daylight and the weather can be good, though Ireland's weather is unpredictable at any time. We could have a beautiful September, or it could be a washout. The first half of June was lovely here, but we have had a lot of rain since then. Other years July can be lovely. Check the forecast for here before you leave and keep an eye on it while you are here."

Bus from Galway to Limerick via Nenagh, it is quicker than train. Changeover in bus station in Limerick. You can then get a local taxi to your destination.

I was in Bray and saw a lot of the east, which I loved dearly, but I also have spent 36 years regretting not getting out west, and I know when my parents think Ireland they're thinking more like Ennis or Galway or Kenmare than they are Dublin... and honestly, I was a lucky brat to get to go and my mom and dad deserve to see nice things and have fun and I want to help with that, because they've been by and large lovely parents).

We have the larger details together. We fly from Boston to Shannon, spending a week in Killarney (taking the coach down... also doing the vast majority of the trip by public transport w/a few private tours to specific sites.) 

Going to take the train from Killarney to Dublin, and while our hotel is in Killiney I don't have qualms about doing the train to LUAS to DART and then either bus/walk or maybe finding a taxi (my parents are in fairly good shape, but none of us have been known for athleticism or coordination, so it's hard to grasp how even minimal luggage might effect things. )

I know Killiney is a bit distant from Dublin,  though not an impossible commute. We have Wednesday and Thursday planned out, and on Friday we head from Dublin ultimately to Ennistymon. My question is this: it seems we have a couple of options for the train cross country.  Would it be more interesting (or aggravating) to go from Dublin to Galway on the train, and take the 350 bus down to Ennistymon? If we stopped in Athenry (that seems to be an option) is there a West Clare type train/coach that could take us to Ennis and we could get a bus to Ennistymon from there? Would the travel from Dublin to Galway on the train look noticeably different landscape feature wise than the train from Dublin to Ennis? 

Since we're going to lose most of the day we travel from home base to home base to plain old travel time, I'd like for that train time to be part of the adventure of it all. I'd also like to have my parents have as less stress as possible (though their requirements seem to be seeing sheep, greenery and rocks, so I think they're going to love it instantly). But if there's a train ride back west that offers something a bit different than the sort of view one sees Killarney to Dublin, even if it is a little longer, that'd kick ass. 

We will be leaving from Shannon as well, so no need to return east again. 

Tl;dr Traveling from Dublin to Ennistymon with elderly parents via train/bus. What transport options do you all think have the best wow/uniqueness factors to make a mundane travel day something special?

Thanks again, all. I am so excited to come back, and I know my mom and dad are going to love it (forgive them if they are loud... they didn't used to be but *are* in denial about the hearing loss).","Would renting a car be an option? I’ve done both rent and car and used public transport and found that for the longer distances, having your own car was most convenient as you can stop/go as you please (there are so many beautiful stops you’d want to make).

The hostels in Ireland,"Hello, I am wondering how to best compile a list of all the hostels in Ireland that are clean, operational now and still rent dorm bed, rather than asking you to rent the whole room.If you have recently stayed in any hostels in Ireland or Northern Ireland, and you loved/hated it Or you have the knowledge of such hostels, I would love to hear from you.

In 2019, my friend had stayed in 5 hostels and it seems either they closed or they are renting only the rooms - making it much more difficult and expensive option. One other thing I will like to know that if the hostel is easy to reach by public transport. Thank you all.","Lus Mor in Roundwood (Wicklow) is definitely focused on being a B&B but they have hostel beds (no bunk beds! Just single beds in a bigger room) and were clean and the food options were amazing. The Generator in Dublin was very clean and had a lot of dorm beds. We also stayed in the Sleepzone Galway (fine but small rooms, multiple toilets/shower stalls out of service) and the Belfast IYH (clean but spartan, some older bathrooms). Lus Mor was honestly probably my favourite hostel ever (and my group all wished we had spent longer there), but they are definitely easier to reach for people travelling by bike/car, but they do have info on their website about arranging pick ups. Everything else was fairly easy to get to."

Visiting last week of Sept for 8 days from the US,"Asking for recommendations and answer to a few quesions. Going with my brother and SIL, only adults. We like to stay in places for a bit to really get to know the area. This is a very relaxed trip with no real plans. We will be renting a car as needed and will use public transportation. We like nature and are open to hiking, as well as hanging out in the city. 

Current loose schedule is:
Sunday: Arrive in dublin renting a car to Belfast.

A few days in Belfast

A few days in Dublin

We at some point, want to hop on over to west Ireland as well, likely Galway, but open to suggestions. And my main touristy goal is the Cliffs of Moher. ☺️

We want to do a Guinness tour in Dublin and since we are crazy Game of Thrones people, a GOT tour. 

Also looking to do tea at a castle, because why not? Castle recommendations are welcome. 

Questions:

What things might I need cash for? 

Anything that you consider a ""must see/do""?

Best restaurant recommendations, we have no preferences. 

Any good local sports teams to see?

Edit: typo, correcting shorthand","Good to know, thank you! I'd really like to use public transportation because ours is basically nonexistent in Texas!"
Rolling luggage in Dublin and Belfast?,"Hello! I'm super excited to visit Ireland in October. I am American and have never travelled internationally. Americans are generally warned that the ludicrously huge rolling bags are a huge no-go in Europe due to uneven sidewalks, a lack of elevators, never ending steps, etc.

I know packing light is always a must, but I'll need a medium sized checked bag because of the trip length. 

I'm flying into Dublin and will take public transportation to our hotels in the city. We are heading to Belfast on the commuter train for a few days as well. We'll be at three hotels total. 

What do you think: is rolling luggage functional enough for Dublin and Belfast? We're pretty able bodied so that isn't a concern, but I don't want to be annoyed by stone streets or a lack of elevators in metro stations. I also don't really want to purchase a backpack just for this trip and would rather roll to save my legs and back. 

Would love thoughts and experiences!","You'll be fine using a roller suitcase here! The streets can be narrow in spots but Dublin and Belfast are both pretty flat so you won't have a huge amount of steps to deal with. 

Just bear in mind there is no underground system in Ireland (assume that's what you mean by metro). From the airport, you will either get a bus or taxi into the city centre. If you're getting a dedicated airport bus, they usually have additional space for bags downstairs so you will be able to store your bags there. There is an ordinary commuter bus (16 or 16A, I'm not sure) which is cheaper but will have limited space for bags. 

From Dublin to Belfast, you will either get an intercity bus or the train. The intercity buses are coaches, so plenty of space for your suitcase underneath the bus. The train will have some luggage storage at the entrance to each carriage."

Dublin is grand and all but I'm not from there so I'll only comment on Belfast. If you haven't already bought the train ticket I would swap that for the X1 translink bus. It's 9£ online and it'll take you through Drogheda, Newry and Belfast Europa and not  lanyon train station which is a little out of the way. 

Secondly I'd keep this link handy https://www.fonacab.com/ we don't hail cabs in Belfast. You either call em, ask hotels to call em or you book on their website. Or you can Uber. 

There's an app called Mlink which we use to buy bus tickets for getting around the city. It's not necessary as you can buy on the bus but it's for sure easier. You just pay and show a code to the driver. 

Translink.co.uk is the link for all your bus timetables. You can find it on Google maps or at the stop too. Belfast is a deceptively big city as it's quite long so definitely make use of the buses when you can. 

Hope you enjoy my city"

Quick question on that. Here in the states, the long distance buses are shiiiiitty. Sometimes literally. Busses have earned a bad reputation and trains are a bit more of a pleasant experience from more countryside views to an overall nicer experience with fellow passengers and the stations. Would you say the bus vs train has an obviously better experience if we want to really enjoy our trip between towns?

Cannot wait to be in your city! If you have a favorite pub I'm all ears."

You can get a travel card called a leap card at most news agents that will allow you to travel and you can top it up from your phone but you will need tickets for the commute from Dublin to Belfast

The train is fine.  It runs mostly parallel with the M1 motorway. The one the bus takes. The buses are big coaches I recommended the X1/X2 because they are bigger. The air coach is a little small imo. I get the bus, it saves money and it's pretty much the same view however you would see a bit more countryside on the train but not much more. The train is a bit more free for people to get drunk and start walking around which really irrks me. Had a carlsberg spilt on me on the train do maybe I'm bias.

If you have the time and want to go between towns a day trip to Drogheda is a good shout. The city isn't all that much but you can see newgrange. One of the oldest structures in the world. Like 5k years old. 

Obviously depends on what you like but Kelly's cellars/ five points would be recommended 'irish bars' (way better than those Dubliners bars 😅) 

Places like sunflower, Henry's are also a good shout

If you want a nightclub Kremlin, limelight"

I've been dreaming of visiting Ireland since I was 13,"Updated to add:

Thank you all so very much for your suggestions and tips...now that I’ve had some time to do some research I’ve added some details

I will be coming in from Porto (or Lisbon), Portugal on Aug 01.  Ideally, I would prefer my trip ends closer to Cork (or anywhere that’s less than 3 hours by train/bus) cuz the show is in Cork on Aug 10, and I would like to head back to Canada (Edmonton) on Aug 11 or Aug 12 at the latest.  I will not be driving when in Ireland, and I am currently looking through GetYourGuide to see what multi day trips are available...

I am also not getting a data plan, and relying on WiFi, I dont know if thats a smart idea for a solo traveller?

\------------------

Hello!

Picture this: a 13 year old kid in India doing her homework with TV playing in the background, and all of a sudden Michael Flatley's Lord of the Dance appears on screen and for an hour and a half she couldn't take her eyes off the screen and has been mesmerized since.  Here I am, 40, recently separated, and approaching life with a new mindset, I bought a ticket for the 25th anniversary of LOTD next month in Cork.  I am travelling solo to Azores, Portugal first for my friends wedding and then figuring out my way to get to Ireland.

A few things I need help with:

* what are some of the affordable cities I could check out fir the scenery or anything worth visiting, so far I have Cork on my list.
* Are there hostels I could stay in that are safe.
* If I was coming in from Portugal into Ireland, what would be the best way? Ferry, flight? I am from Canada and I have been looking at transportation websites in Europe and I’m starting to get overwhelmed.
* Do I make Dublin my last stop so I can fly back to Canada with ease, or are there other airports that are just as efficient?
* Also, are there apps to meet local friendly people, or do I just take all my anxiety and go into a bar and talk to someone there? I feel like hanging out with some locals, would be an awesome travelling experience, just don’t know where to begin! Any help is appreciated 😊","You should have a great time. I've been to Ireland and am going back with my wife and kids this month. We're going for 17 days and driving around the entire island. I've packed a lot in, and we are going to see a LOT.

One thing I was surprised about since my last trip to Ireland (years ago) is how Fng EXPENSIVE Dublin is! Hotels start at $250 per night, hostels are currently $150 for a bed in a multi-person bunk dorm!!! I've never seen anything like this before - even in peak season.

If I were you I would limit my stay in Dublin to 2 days max, see everything you can and GTFO to the rest of the country.

I have found other towns and cities to be more resonably priced.

As for whether to go to Dublin first or last, that will depend on your actual itinerary, but we are going there FIRST, as our flights are roundtrip from Toronto to Dublin. For our last day we are staying near Newgrange and I'll drive to the airport on the last day of the trip.

In my experience to meet local people, just find a nice pub or restaurant in the town/city you are in, stand at the bar (don't sit a t a table as you'll probably be left alone to eat) and strike up conversations. This has always worked for me. If you stay at a hostel I am sure the staff can point you in a good direction to meet friendly locals.

As an idea of where to go while you are there, this is my itinerary:

And Derry is lovely.  Looking at both sets of murals from the walls is an experience. 

It's not so much that Malin Head is a must, it more that it is absolutely gorgeous.  It's a long drive out from Derry, surprisingly so.  A car would make it much easier. 

Look if you don't have a car.  Then spend a night in Belfast.  And travel down to Dublin, you'll be able to see stuff without using public transport. 

Seeing Ireland without a car is difficult.  In ten years you might come back and travel some of the country."

Fly out of Dublin at 10 am","Your Wednesday plan seems  too busy given you only land in Dublin at 10am (and it'll be another 30-60mins getting out of the airport). If you're on public transport, you'll need to allow about 4 hours minimum to get to Portrush. My suggestion would be the Aircoach or Dublin Express coaches from Dublin Airport to Belfast, then the train from GVS to Portrush. 

I would try and do Carrick A Rede and the Causeway on the same excursion. Maybe Bushmills distillery on the Wednesday afternoon and the others on Thursday?

Friday transport plans look fine, but even though I live in Donegal, given you're time constrained I'd suggest just spending the day in and around Derry. Absolutely loads to see and fantastic places to eat. If your husband wanted he could get an early round in at Portatewart/Portrush on friday morning. I'd recommend staying in Derry that night, then getting the bus to Belfast Saturday morning. Train journey is long and will take you back the way you came on Friday anyway. 

In Belfast I wouldn't bother with the castle, but as someone else has said, definitely consider a black cab tour and maybe the Crumlin Road Gaol. Not sure how into your food you are, but your suggestions there aren't going to be memorable - they're fairly run of the mill places!  I don't know anything about Kirkistown so no suggestions for you there!

Swap out Dublin Castle for Kilmainham Gaol on Sunday and your Dublin option looks good. 

Hope that's helpful!"

Best Way to Galway?,"Hello everyone! And thank you to those who piped in a few weeks ago and helped me convince my significant other that we should split our home base between Dublin and Galway for our 8-day trip. 

(Note this will be our first time in Ireland, and we don't have a ton of information on transportation, public or otherwise.)

That being said, what is the best way to get from Dublin Airport to Galway? Our flight doesn't get in until about 3:00 in the afternoon (if there are no delays), and honestly cannot fathom driving right away after our long trek from California. (We will be renting a car in Galway, though.)

Also, any advice on the best way to get back to Dublin (Dun Laoghaire) from Galway? Note we will be using public transportation in and around Dublin/Dun Laoghaire.","There are buses (coaches) from Dublin airport straight to Galway city centre. They only stop once, in Dublin City. City link and Go Bus are owned by the same company - choose the time that suits you best and book a ticket online."
Planning a trip to Ireland in April. I'd love some suggestions.,"What sites are must see in terms of nature? I'll be there for 8 days. Not really a big city person although I hear Dublin is unlike anywhere else? 

I am traveling with 3 other people to Ireland who have never been. I've been to England 3 times and Wales once. Loved my experience and from my understanding,  Ireland's public transportation is not as advanced? 

Renting a car may be a better option? 


Any personal advice would be great. Thanks",">Ireland's public transportation is not as advanced? 

It's pretty poor all around and very poor outside of the main cities. If you want to visit places like Wicklow national Park or Connemara you can't really do it without a car unless you want to join a tour group. 

If you have the option to rent a car I'd strongly recommend it, you'll get a lot more freedom and will likely have a very different experience"

Any personal advice would be great. Thanks","If you are here for eight days, that gives you some time to explore Dublin city. It is a coastal city and a rail service called the DART will bring you along some of that coast, which you might like. Going to Howth on the northern end of the line and Bray on the south, would be good. Dublin is also close to some mountains, just south of the city. A day tour to Wicklow would be a good idea.

Getting further from Dublin, you can heard to the west coast. Anywhere from Kerry in the southwest up to Donegal in the northwest will give you some very nice scenery and nature to explore. Be it the Dingle Peninsula or Connemara or the hills and cliffs of Donegal, you will find no shortage of places to meet your requirements. Maybe aim to base  yourself in a few places, like Killarney for the Kerry area and Galway city for Connemara, for example. Get a good map of Ireland out and have a look so you can make some plans."

Thank you for all of your advice and helpful feedback on this sub!",Galway arts festival is on for two weeks from 17th July. If that matches with your dates you can book tickets on [GIAF.ie](https://www.giaf.ie/) .  The journey from Dublin airport to Westport is awkward and long by public transport (4hrs 45 using train according to Rome to Rio). You can get a Citylink bus from Dublin airport direct to Galway - stay in Galway. Then do Westport afterwards. It would break up that long journey on your first day.

"Tours, self-driving or public transport to popular attractions","I’m travelling to Ireland from Canada in two weeks, and couldn’t be more excited!

For around Killarney the hop-on hop-off big red bus is a good option to see various spots near to Killarney. 

https://killarneytour.com/killarney-tour/

Another option for Killarney is to rent bikes in town. You can easily cycle to Ross Castle and out to Muckross and see a lot of the National Park.

I always recommend the Gap of Dunloe trip in Killarney. It's a trip through the Gap (either walk/bike/jaunting car) and then on boats down the lakes to Ross Castle. There are a number of operators for this trip.

There's a number of day trip bus tours from Killarney around the Ring of Kerry. It's a good way to see a lot of the Kerry in a day. 

Can't recommend any tour company as never actually used any."

Social anxiety and public transportation,"Hi all, I'm visiting Ireland in June for a conference and although I'm super excited to visit such a beautiful country the concept of public transport terrifies me. I come from south africa so it's very much not a thing here and I'm confused about the different bus services, how to buy tickets, how to figure out the routes etc. I'm ashamed to say that the idea of how I indicate where I want to go to the bus driver alone has kept me up at night. 

Any helpful tips or tricks? Is Google maps to be trusted and what is the best e hailing app for an emergency?","Oh my goodness you poor thing! it's really easy (be glad!). Statistically I am going to assume you want to go to Dublin. If ya don't that is ok, but am just giving this off the bat since you didn't specify a location. 

Firstly, it's super easy. If you are in Dublin you want a leap card. You can buy this almost Everywhere (I think it's five euro). When you get it you can top it up by your phone with the leap card app. Once you have money on it then it's really simple. You go to your bus stop , hold out your arm when your bus comes, it stops and you hold your card to a big giant pad that everyone will hold their card to (trust me you can't miss it). Then your card will be deducted 2 euro. 

It's that simple. Now, if you are travelling a really short journey you can go to the driver and hold your card to his pad. At this point you can say the name of your destination and he will take the right amount from you. Or you can just say the price ""1.30 please"". and they will take that off you if you are travelling a small amount. 

That's all there is to it. There are only two prices. 

When in doubt ya can pay the extra seventy cents and just pay at the pad the driver is not using. If ya want to know what it is like here ya go: 

https://www.echolive.ie/cms_media/module_img/4310/2155058_1_seoimage16x9_Leap.jpg


Now, the Luas is our tram system. Frankly that is ten time easier. You use the same leap card but you tap the pad (just like on the bus but on each luas station)before you get on and when you get off you tap the pad too. 

That's it! It's really easy. Please do contact me if you feel confused.

PS just know that you dont need a leap card. That is just one of a few methods you can use. In buses you can also pay by change. With the luas you can also buy a ticket which has a machine at every stop.

This can be a great trip for you, don't let you social anxiety get in the way. I see plenty of people who are irish who need to ask ""hey am i doing this right?"". Go easy on yourself :)"

Any helpful tips or tricks? Is Google maps to be trusted and what is the best e hailing app for an emergency?","Hi!! Just want you to know I felt this so hard and I hear your anxiety about this!! I just got back from a solo trip to Ireland and I promise you, the people there are quite literally the nicest human beings on the face of the planet. When I landed in Dublin and walked out of the airport, it was raining and I immediately got overwhelmed with trying to figure out how to get into city centre. Luckily, there are several buses basically right out front that say they’re airport shuttles that take people to and from city centre, and the guy who worked at the airport could not have been sweeter, explaining to me how to buy my ticket and where to stand while I waited and to be out of the rain. I got into Dublin with no problems at all!

I’m following along with other people’s comments that you’re probably headed to Dublin? If so, I actually ended up up walking everywhere I needed to go. I understand that for a conference, you might need to go to some convention center outside of city centre or something, but just within the day-to-day functions of leaving your hotel, getting breakfast, exploring the city a little on your off time, you can absolutely walk most places.

I use Apple Maps personally, and paid the extra $10/day on my phone plan specifically so that I could have precise location on while using it. I’ve heard Google Maps is pretty accurate as well, but I feel like if whatever app you’re using can pinpoint exactly where you are, it’s going to be much easier to navigate which bus stop you need to be at and which bus you need to get on. Also, since public transport isn’t a thing in South Africa, if you have any worries about it being gross or scary like it may seem in some parts of America, please don’t! The buses I took both in Ireland and in Scotland were clean and properly taken care of. It’s nothing like a New York City subway, thank goodness.

Finally, if all else fails, please know that the bus drivers are kind and do have it in their heart to help you. I know that even knowing someone has good intentions in an interaction doesn’t make actually going up and talking to them any easier, but they are good people and they understand if you don’t know how things work. I’ve always had social anxiety but I can truthfully say that my trip to Ireland helped me get over my anxiety in a lot of ways (on my first night in Dublin, I ended up meeting these strangers at a festival who I was out dancing and having the time of my life with until 3am who I still keep in touch with to this day- that is something I could NEVER do back home!) because of the compassion of its people. Your fears are so valid and I sincerely hope that you find comfort in having the info others have shared and in knowing that the people of Ireland are literal angels!! Have fun!!"

I use google maps and the TFI live app (sometimes the google one isn’t right but it usually is). If you’re going outside of Dublin I’ve used the Bus Éireann services and those you just buy a ticket on the app  (TFI Go). None of these services you have to tell the bus driver where you get off, they do the same route and you just press the bell!
If you’re getting the aircoach from the airport - you can buy ticket on their website or outside your terminal, the bus driver will ask you where you’re getting off at and that’s it, they’re very lovely.

You’ll be okay, I’m much more comfortable with Dublin transport than with the public transport back home in England."

There are apps you can download to your phone to give you the ETA as well as the scheduled time (which often are not exactly the same because traffic). You can buy tickets online in advance using these apps and you just have to show it to the driver when you get on, and often scan it with the device they have on the bus - no biggie. Also, you can tell the bus driver directly where you want to get off, like 'can you let me know where to get off for the Epic Museum?' for example. Not an issue, they get asked stuff like this all the time. Generally the stop is announced just before the bus or train stops at it, and then when they move away they announce the name of the next stop. 

And the great thing about public transport is that locals use it and you can easily strike up a conversation with them, and they'll give you all kinds of useful information about where you're going."

Galway - what to do?,"Driving from killarney to galway right now and trying to decide what I want to do tomorrow. 

I've already decided I don't want to do the ferry to the aran islands or a bus tour to the cliffs of moher. In general I don't like full day trips where I cannot decide myself when/for how long to take breaks and move along.

I just looked up coasteering and that seems amazing, only thing is that I travel by public transport and apparently you need your own car to get there.

I saw oysterfarming which seemed really cool but that's not avaliable on Friday.

Soo, what to do? Its my last day in Ireland so I want to make te most of it!

I like to do something active that's either independent (I can decide myself how long I'll stay somewhere etc.) Or a guided tour that's max a half day. Out of the box is good, I like niche things. 

Any recommendations?",Aran Islands you can take a e-bike around at your own pace.  Only thing you have to do is be back on the boat by like 5pm or so.  That's the only schedule you have.
9 nights and a few questions,"Hey everyone! I read a lot of good advices and now I think I need some too. We planned to stay 9 nights (July) in Ireland and don’t want to schedule too much.

Spending an extra day around Dublin,"Hi all,

in my current travel plans for travelling to Ireland with a group of friends, there were some changes, such that I will be the first of them, to arrive on late Friday afternoon at Dublin airport. The only thing that is fixed right now is that I will meet the next friend to arrive Sunday noon in Dublin, leaving me with \~1.5 days to spend at my own pace.

So far, my idea was to visit Glendalough (I would love to do some hiking, ideally around some more ancient parts of Ireland). However, I'll have to rely on public transportation, and my plane will land just too late (touch down at 5pm, if it is on time) to catch the last bus to Glendalough from St. Kevins bus service in Dublin, leaving me with not really reliable options to get there at a reasonable time, or alternatively taking a cab for \~150€ at that time of day. So overall, this plan leaves me with a bit of a stomach ache, mostly because there are so many unknowns even before arriving at Glendalough - while it sounds doable in principle, it also sounds stressful.

Do you have any alternative ideas for destinations to check out in such a short time? Alternatively I was considering just doing a guided bus tour to Wicklow mountains from Dublin on the full day, however I would prefer to somehow get the hiking part squeezed in, which is probably not gonna happen on a guided tour.","Glendalough is gorgeous.  Consider going out sat morning and come back in on Sunday morning.  I'm not sure if that is possible either with public transport. 

A different option is Dublin mountains.  Taxi or bus out to Ticknock.  The edge of Dublin city comes right up to the mountains.  Take a look on AllTrails for length of walk options ."

Mainly because the valley slopes have been logged and make it look ugly.

Using the DART, either head to Howth for the Howth Head walk, which is lovely, or head to Bray and go to Greystones over the top route of Bray Head (the lower route on the cliffs is closed due to landslides)"

Ireland solo travel in September without a car,"So I’m solo travelling to Ireland in September for this year and I will be in the country for 14 days. I’m not going to be renting a car and I was looking into all the train and bus routes and they do seem pretty good. Based on the research I’ve done, maybe people are saying that pubic transportation isn’t the greatest in Ireland lol.

So far I know I want to check out Dublin, Galway and Killarney. I’m a little torn between leaving time for Cork with day trips to the Blarney Stone and Cobh or go further up the west coast to either Westport or Sligo, mainly because of the hikes.

I’m interested in doing some day hikes and day trips to some charming towns as well. I have looked into doing some great looking hikes but I don’t know if I’m squeezing things in too much as I want to take my time in each place to reduce travel days due to not having a car. 

Here are a list of possible day trips 

- Howth
- Connemara Diamond Trial 
- Aran Islands 
- Cliffs of Moher 
- Croagh Patrick

- Waterford - Greenway - Dungarven
- Cobh

Thanks!","Ireland trains to get between Dublin and a lot of different towns are actually really good and affordable, especially compared to the UK. 

However, getting out to hiking spots without a car will be much more difficult and getting between towns on trains is more difficult, especially in the West. Look up a rail line map of Ireland and you'll see what I mean. There are buses of course but they're slower, less comfortable and  not that frequent. 

There are tour companies that will take you on day trips from the town centres, and some of them can take you to multiple places but then you're obviously on the bus schedule."

Thanks!","The best thing to do is find a few bases for the day trips.  Dublin would be good as a base for Howth and Connemara.  Howth is not even a day trip.  It is a short train or bus ride from the city centre and you could spend just a few hours there, giving you plenty to time to do other things on that day.  Glendalough would take longer, but is a good place to visit.  As another example of a base, Galway would be good for going to the Aran Islands, Connemara and the Cliffs of Moher.  You can easily get a variety of day trips from Galway.

Irish public transport is reasonably good for getting to the big towns and cities.  Getting to more remote parts is obviously a bit more awkward, and where a car would be useful.  Obviously that adds the problem of navigation and getting used to driving.  You can certainly get away with public transport, with a bit of planning.  Look at the idea of using several bases and then public transport or organised tours from those bases."

For Howth, if you look at a nap, you can see it is very close to the city centre. It would depend on exactly where you are staying, but it is an easy place to get to. There is a small seaside village there and you can do some walks around the area. If you took your time you could get hours out of it, but you could get a lot of other things done on the same day. In the same theme, you could use the rail line that goes north from the city to Howth and also head south of the city towards Dún Laoghaire, Bray and Greystones. Add all of those places to the list and you could fill a day."
Doolin to Dingle - How to get back to Dublin?,"Hello! I am visiting Ireland in mid February and am very much looking forward to it! Roughly here is my plan:

Flying into Dublin, will spend a few days there.Take the train to Galway, spend 2 nights there.Then I must get from Galway to Doolin (planning on taking the bus?) where I will be staying so I can walk the cliffs. I will stay in Doolin Tuesday night.I fly back home Friday afternoon.

My question is what should I do Wed-Fri. I would enjoy something more nature/landscape focused than bopping around a town. How accessible is the Dingle Peninsula from Doolin? Will I have to rent a car? ---My initial hope was to rely entirely on public transport trains/buses because I am American and am anxious about driving on the left side of the road! But I am beginning to see what a time-suck that is. Should I try to rent a car in Galway, then I can drive to Doolin, then adventure out to Dingle / Kerry? Or is that too far? How should I get back to Dublin for my flight? Just drive all the way or drop the rental car off some place like Killarney / Limerick / ?? then take the direct train to Dublin.  (Of note, I don't mind ""long"" drives as I'm from the Midwest and would consider anything <5h relatively short, but I'm just more anxious about the narrow roads and wrong side).

Thank you for your help! Reminder it will be winter!","I gotta be honest, doolin to dingle is a hellish slog on public transport.  You're going from rural to rural, so you'll see the weakest links in our bus network at both ends.

You're looking at Doolin to Ennis, Ennis to Limerick, Limerick to Tralee, and Tralee to Dingle.  All-in you're looking at a full day of travel - like 8+ hours of busses vs 3 hours of driving.

I use a site rome2rio.com for scoping out trips like this.  It's global, but within Ireland it does pretty well with national (public&private) bus & rail services, but it does seem to be missing some of the very rural private bus services.

I will say though - don't underestimate driving here.  I know what you mean, I spent a few years in Michigan and driving there is totally different.  Wider roads, straighter roads, miles and miles of cruise control.  Driving around Claire is going to be about as different as you can get (while staying on pavement).

On the other hand - do keep in mind we have short days in the winter, we're deceptively far north.  I'm in Galway, we're about as far north as Edmonton, Alberta.  In the middle of feb you're still looking at 8am-6pm daylight, so 8 hours on a bus is a whole day of daylight.

Overall - I would recommend renting a car, but I would be careful planning long drives (unless it's something like the ring of kerry where that's the whole point).  For a pro-tip on our road numbering, road numbers starting with M are our version of freeways, no problem.  Roads starting with N are national and are mostly fine.  Roads starting with R are regional and are going to be more work than you're used to.  And roads starting with L are local and [can vary wildly](/r/ireland/comments/ciftbm/surprisingly_not_photoshop/) - so drives hitting a lot of R and L roads are going to be a lot more tiring than Google betrays."

A week in Ireland as digital nomad,"Hello there,
I'll be in Ireland in two weeks, working from there during the day and planning to visit places once I'm off from work.
The ""if I need to go back"" base will be Wicklow (town), but besides that the plan can be totally to travel around and see as many things as possible. 

I'm would like to do a 3 days trip during the weekend and try to freestyle during the other days.

I don't have a car so I will rely on public transport.

For the 3-days trip I was thinking about visiting some islands but not mandatory; any suggestions? 
Are there websites that suggest public-transport trips only?

Edit:
If there are some places where I can rent a car and it's affordable (I've seen 800€ for two days and 1k for a week, so I'd avoid these prices) I can totally rent it (in the range of 50-100max a day)","You are kind of on the wrong side of the country for visiting the islands,  even with a car. Getting to Galway and beyond would be a challenge with public transport  and even with a car would take the best part of a day there and another back. 
To be honest,  from Wicklow Town you are kind of stymied without a car, as you'll need to get back to Dublin to make connections.  If you can sort out a car at all, you have loads to do and see from your vase without travelling too far. The Wicklow Mountains, with Glendalough and great walks, are very close. With a car, day trips or overnights down the N11 to Wexford,  the Hook Peninsula,  across in a tiny car ferry to Waterford,  Copper Coast, back upcountry to Kilkenny,  and circle back to Wicklow"
Itinerary question - countryside around Cork (accessible by train/bus),"I will be travelling in Europe (from Australia) in April-May next year with our one year old.

I think if you want to explore more towns, you might be better off using the buses? [www.buseireann.ie](https://www.buseireann.ie)

If you only have 4 nights, just stay in one place. Way easier. You can fly into either Cork or Dublin, personally I would choose Cork. If you do, then I strongly recommend just hiring a car and heading off out towards Kinsale and beyond. I would suggest the town of Clonakilty as a base for exploring the region, you could see a couple of the peninsulas (Mizen Head, Sheep Head, Béara, not all in one day), and head inland as well. Blarney Castle complex is wonderful, the castle itself is nothing special - yeah, there's that kissing the stone thing, but given that Covid numbers are still high in Ireland, I wouldn't. There are hundreds of castle ruins to be seen, you just need to check it's okay to go walk around them, as they are usually on private property and you need the landowner's permission to enter - easy to get, just ask at the nearest house who the landowner is."

Sounds fairly hectic. Factoring in travel, airport, and commuting time between the cities. Time spent getting between attractions and even - getting some sleep.
You might be biting off more than you can chew? Especially since travelling with a one year old can be like manuvering the 5th armoured column.  :-)

You might think about choosing either Cork or Dublin?

Assuming you're choosing one or the other. I'll argue the case for Cork, and I'll let other posters make the case for Dublin.

- Cork airport is much easier to use and more convenient than Dublin airport.
- Cork is a great walking city. You can walk to most attractions in the city centre.
- If Blarney Castle, visiting a small town and seeing the countryside is on your bucket list in Ireland. Then Cork is perfect (see below).
- Dublin is a big city. With all the advantages and disadvantages that brings. Things go at a more leisurely pace in Cork. The city is more relaxed.

>We’ll probably catch public transport between Cork-Blarney Castle, and Cork-Cobh.

I wouldn't waste time looking for bus stops and waiting for buses to Blarney Castle. A taxi to Blarney from the city centre will set you back around 30 Euros ($47 AUD). Use the Free Now taxi app to order a taxi near you, I use it all the time. It works all over Ireland.

There's a train from Cork city to Cobh. It takes around 25 mins and the views of the harbour are spectacular. It's the only way to travel to Cobh IMO.

Along the way, you might want to check out Fota Wildlife Park. It's ideal for a relaxed family day out. The weather should be fine in April/May.

>Are there any places on these train trips that we could get off to have a bit of a walk/explore of some smaller towns/ beautiful countryside?

This should be no problem. Given that Cobh is a charming, small town in itself. Make sure to check out the wonderful Cathedral and the Titanic Museum, near the centre of town.

Blarney Castle is set on a wonderful estate with extensive, award-winning gardens. You could also rent a taxi per hour if you wish. Probably easier and cheaper than renting a car. Ask the driver to bring you to the countryside.

Last tip: you might want to check out the whale watching off the Cork coast. This can be an experience you'll want to write home about.

Best of luck with your Irish adventure..."
Winter Trip to Ireland,"Hello everyone!

Sorry to post another post like that, but I would like to get opinions for strictly winter time.

I’m coming back to Poland for Christmas this year, and my partner and I are planning to visit Ireland either before Christmas, or after NYE.
It will be shortish (7-14 days) trip. We prefer more B&B style accommodations, than hotels and would love to see mostly older attractions like old ruins, Celtic monoliths (I hope that’s the correct word) or natural sightseeing places.
Currently we have: Dunseverick Castle (Northern Ireland), Carrowkeel passage Tombs, Muckross Abbey.

I’m looking for places that are best to see during winter, or at least as good as they are during summer. 

We are not sure we will be able to visit all of them, but currently we are looking for ideas, so that we can plan accordingly.

Also, I would appreciate your opinion about public transport during winter in Ireland. Is it worth renting a car, or would trains and busses be enough? I assume that some of the best places to visit are only accessible by car, as there won’t be many busses going there, but if we will find enough places easily accessible from busses, we may stick to them.

I would appreciate all of your opinions and recommendations.

Thank you in advance!

It ended up much longer than I anticipated, so sorry for that.

Edited: I’ve learned the difference between B&B and Airbnb…","Rent the car, you don't want to be left waiting on buses or trains in the pissings of freezing rain"

Ireland from Dec 26th - Dec 31st,"Hey everyone! I have been reading a lot of posts here, and really appreciate everyone who contributes and offers suggestions!

Looking for a few suggestions to help shape my wife and I’s first trip to not only Europe… but Ireland! 

We have 5 nights, and are looking for a comfortable balance of active exploring/hiking, relaxing at pubs for a chunk of the day (we are huge Guinness and beer fans). Any “authentic” Irish experiences. We are not so much into historical things such a castles, but can absolutely appreciate their beauty and if a nice active hike incorporates something such as this, we are of course open!

Planning on 2 ish nights in Dublin, maybe 2 ish nights and Galway, and 1 more night in Dublin.  Prior to us departing to Brussels on Dec 31st at 7am. I am interested in day trips to maybe Howth, def Cliffs of Moher. Any other day trip suggestions?

Also, trying to decide on renting a car vs public transportation. Since we are just doing 5 days and plan on 2 ish cities with day trips renting a car didn’t seem ultra necessary, but open to information.

Thank you everyone! Doing 2 weeks in Europe, and I am by far the most excited to visit Ireland!!!","Get the car for when outside of Dublin, you're chasing daylight and possibly very shit weather, you don't want to have public transport on top of that"
10 Day Itinerary Issues,"I’m a solo traveller, with a trip planned for Sept 29-Oct 8 (10 full days in Ireland). 

I’m having some problems figuring out the best possible itinerary. I know I will be arriving in Dublin and heading straight to Galway for 2-3 days via rail. And I also know I want to end my trip with 2-3 days in Dublin.

My problem lies between the first and last destinations. I trying to decide between Killarney or Cork or both for a couple days. 

Any suggestions would help. I also will only be travelling by public transportation, not renting a car.","I second getting the bus from airport direct to Galway, it is the cheapest, fastest and most convenient way.

Book your day trips from Galway, you should have plenty of time in the evening to see around Galway. Do 2 day trips, picking from Cliffs, Aran Islands, Connemara, you can make that decision a few days beforehand when u see the weather forecast. 


I would just go to Killarney and skip Cork. Do day trips from Killarney. This makes more sense when you are travelling by public transport. Get the train back to Dublin.

 It will take most of the day to travel from Galway to Killarney. Get on the first bus out of Galway to make most of your day."

Looking for references for public transportation.,Spending 9 days in ireland/ northern ireland. I plan to ride buses to my location. Would appreciate any insight on the transportation system out there. Is there a bus pass that i can buy?,"There's a leap card that you can top up but it only works in Ireland and not on every service. The Bus Eireann network isn't total so you might have to use private company buses too.

Really what you have to do is plot your route and then work out if you can do it with buses. 

But bear in mind that buses here are functional so won't always go near whatever tourism spot you might want to go to."

Best way to see Ireland with Autism/Medical,"Hello! I (38F) am visiting Ireland this spring with my sister (30F). We are both neurodivergent, and I am medically complex.

Going completely independently doesn't seem as fun - I like the expertise and stories of the guides! And I don't want to worry about transportation.

Now, the wider public won't know what that is but anyone working public transport should, it might be something to consider getting. 

Without knowing the specifics of your medical needs (and that's not me asking) the above is about all anyone could tell you.

Thank you!","In Dublin I just showed up in my wheelchair and told a staff member I would need assistance. They arrange everything for you right then. They accompanied me to the train, did the ramp thing, helped me board. Then someone waited for me when I arrived at my destination, did the ramp thing again, and helped me off. It all worked exactly the same way on my return journey.

Buses/coaches need a heads up though, at least 24 hours ahead of time. I don't mean inner-city buses, I unfortunately don't have experience with them. But the buses between cities and towns. They want to make sure they have the accessible buses available on the right day, time and route. Just call them. The driver will assist boarding, etc.

Edit to add about taxis. Request a big wheelchair taxi when booking, or else they might rock up with a regular car."

What are the things in Ireland you shouldnt miss?,"Hello. I gonna travel to Ireland next year and want to know what you think are the things and places you shouldnt miss. Basically the only thingim i know is the Dublin Spire and that people hate it.  Im gonna stay for about two weeks. And also, how is the public transport situation in Ireland?
Thanks","Visited Ireland in October.  I did a Rail Tour to the Cliffs of Moher and Connemara, it was 2 days, included hotel and the bus tour tickets, cost about $360 and it was absolutely gorgeous.  A lot of people naturally recommended seeing the Cliffs but I did not know a thing about Connemara and that was just as beautiful as the Cliffs, just a different landscape.

Also did a Rail. Tour to Cork, Ring of Kerry, Killarney and that was also wonderful.  Even if you don’t do RailTours, look up their website to get ideas.

Also if you are a fan of Game of Thrones take a Winterfell Trek Tour.  I did a one day tour.  It took us from Dublin to Northern Ireland, besides being fun and interesting , we were in some beautiful forests, parks in Northern Ireland."

Thanks","All I can say for definite is you won't be able to land on the Skelligs anyway that time of year. Public Transport outside of a major urban centre can be hit and miss, so if it's somewhere like the Cliff of Moher you're looking at going to, an organised bus trip might be your best bet (those would be weather dependent too)"
Twelve days in June,"Hello! There's two of us, mid-30s, planning a trip in June that will be just under two weeks. The big goal for us is scenery. We will be renting a car, and we're hoping to make it to Northern Ireland, and we are aware a car may not be covered and so we're factoring in possibly having to do that bit with public transportation. We don't have interest in Blarney Castle or spending too much time in Dublin as much as we're just ready to explore.

We would love some feedback about our tentative itinerary. We are aware we may need to cut out the Dingle Peninsula or the Ring of Kerry, and are open to that. We'd love opinions on which to do, though, if we need to narrow it down.

Sat: Flight out 3:50, (layover \~3 hours), overnight to Dublin.  
Sun: Arrive 7:45 AM in Dublin. Stay in Dublin.  
Mon: Rent car. Wicklow/Glendalough. Stay in Kilkenny.  
Tues: Kilkenny. Stay in Kilkenny.  
Wed: Dingle Peninsula/Slea Head. Stay in Dingle.  
Thurs: Ring of Kerry. Stay in Killarney.  
Fri: Cliffs of Moher. Stay on Inis Mor.  
Sat: Aran Islands. Stay on Inis Mor.  
Sun: Galway. Stay in Galway.  
Mon: Either stay in Galway again or return car to Dublin, stay in Dublin (stop in Athlone?).  
Tues: Derry. Stay in Derry.  
Wed: Belfast. Stay in Belfast.  
Thurs: Belfast. Stay in Belfast.  
Fri: Return to Dublin, flight out 1:15PM

Also, I love a good pub scene but no longer drink; is it easy enough to find non-alcoholic beers? I'd hate to miss out, but I also don't want to just take up space.","If you are going from Galway to Derry go straight there, don’t return to Dublin, it’s going completely in the wrong direction. Derry is worth seeing, especially if you are interested in the history of The Troubles. It’s an awkward place to get to though so you could cut it out and just go Galway, Dublin (drop car) Belfast on public transport, Dublin Airport. Dublin airport is the Belfast side of Dublin so you might be able to stay in Belfast on your last day and go straight from Belfast to Dublin airport if the public transport allows it time wise."
Originally Planned to Rent a Car But. . .,"Heyo! So I've meticulously planned out my upcoming Feb/Jan trip to NIreland/Ireland :)
Albeit most food stops left out so I can just ask when I'm there. I had an ss but realize I can't post photos. I'll be spending at least a full day in each area. 

My trip goes Belfast ➡️ Bushmills/Causeway➡️Derry➡️Donegal. 

I was originally gonna rent a car but I found out I was too young and the cost would be phenomenal. What modes of transportion would you reccomend for each spot and across?

I *was* thinking a bicycle for the cities but remembering how traffic is makes me a bit timid on that. Perhaps find a bike rental in Donegal would be amazing. What are ya'lls thoughts on biking around in Belfast and Derry?

I know from Belfast to Bushmills there's an amazing train ride? I'd love to do that, but then the real question is, what is there for Bushmills to Derry, and Derry to Donegal? 

The buses reliable enough ?

How expensive are the average rates for taxis compared to ubers if I need to get somewhere in a pinch? Any scams to look out for with or around public transportation? 

I'll also need to head back to Belfast to catch my returning flight. 

Thank you guys so much :)","It’s gonna be hard to get directly to Bushmills from Belfast, but if you catch the train to Coleraine you can then get the Causeway rambler bus to Bushmills- that same bus will take you to the Causeway (actually I just looked- you can get a bus directly to Bushmills- who knew!). It runs regularly enough, like every half hour to 45 minutes, but stops in the early evening so make sure to account for that! The TransLink trip planner app is good to get that information. Bushmills to Derry you’ll get that same bus to Coleraine and get on the train to Derry. I’m not familiar with the biking situation or transport to Donegal unfortunately. Taxis are usually cheaper and have more of a presence than Uber, you can either call, find a taxi stand, or just find one on the street. If you’re in Derry you can get a bus or train quite easily to one of the Belfast stations and then take local transport to the airport, or get the “Airporter” coach that will take you directly there. Best of luck!

ETA: both Belfast and Derry are pretty walkable, especially with the main things you’ll probably want to see. I think biking should be fine, but it’s definitely not the infrastructure of somewhere like the Netherlands. Otherwise both cities have local public transport as well."

Thank you guys so much :)","Get yourself a hotel near the city centers and you won’t need to bike at all. Most places are within 10 minutes of each other and the few places that are further you can taxi to. This is a better option than wrangling a bike around.  This applies to each of the cities you’ll be traveling through, especially Donegal. That is not a big town at all.  

It is unfortunate that you won’t be able to get a rental while touring NI and Donegal, because the most beautiful places up you’d likely need a car to get to. Though there should be some sort of bus tour that would get you around the Antrim coastline for places like Giants Causeway, Dunluce Castle, Carrick-a-rede, the temple, and others.

I’m not great with public transportation in Ireland, but keep searching bus tours for Northern Ireland or Antrim and maybe you’ll find what you need"

Only train that connects from Coleraine near Causeway stops at Portrush. It also looks neat to see eh.

I'll walk the 12 or so miles along the coast and see everything, stop at Bothy Cafe and let my legs die. Probably take a good 5-6 hours since I'll be stopping a lot. 

Call a cab to see the hedges and then another to take me back to Coleraine Station. Then off to Derry.

Feedback on my 16 day itinerary,"Hi all, I’m visiting Ireland for the first time in a few months 31/8-16/9. I’ve been doing lots of research, trying to figure out what all I’d like to see so I can plan which days I’m staying in which towns. I’ve made a rough itinerary and will only be using public transportation. Looking for feedback on my itinerary and possibly suggestions for public transport between each of these cities. I’ve briefly looked at transportforireland.ie but any other suggestions would be appreciated. I’m mostly wondering if I should get a bus pass or buy bus tickets same day. I’ve also read buying train tickets in advance will save me money so I’m planning on doing that.

Here's a link I found: [https://gobus.ie/](https://gobus.ie/)

I have no idea how you would get to Portmagee by public transport, it's in the middle of nowhere!

When you are in Cork you could get a bus to Kinsale from the central bus station - Kinsale in nice to walk around and you can walk out of the town to Charlesfort, an old fort with spectacular views. Plenty pubs on the way! You can also take a train to Cobh and see the Titanic exhibition"
Feedback on my 16 day itinerary,"Hi all, I’m visiting Ireland for the first time in a few months 31/8-16/9. I’ve been doing lots of research, trying to figure out what all I’d like to see so I can plan which days I’m staying in which towns. I’ve made a rough itinerary and will only be using public transportation. Looking for feedback on my itinerary and possibly suggestions for public transport between each of these cities. I’ve briefly looked at transportforireland.ie but any other suggestions would be appreciated. I’m mostly wondering if I should get a bus pass or buy bus tickets same day. I’ve also read buying train tickets in advance will save me money so I’m planning on doing that. 

31/8 Land in Dublin

31/8-5/9 Dublin

-explore Dublin (won’t go into detail here I’m just spreading it all out between my few days here)
-Paddywagon tour to Belfast one day



5/9 travel to Drogheda

5/9-7/9 Drogheda

-relax in a peaceful Airbnb
-check out Newgrange



7/9 travel to Cork

7/9-10/9 Cork

-explore Cork (and luckily I’ll be there during the West Cork food Festival!)

10/9 travel to Portmagee
10/9-12/9 Portmagee

-only staying here so I can do the landing tour to Skellig Michael



12/9 travel to Galway
12/9-15/9 Galway
-explore Galway
-Cliffs of another (debating if I should do a tour or just take public transport to the visitor center?)



15/9 travel to Dublin

16/9 fly home 


I feel like I’m giving myself enough time in each place but any feedback is appreciated. I’d love to see Londonderry/Derry and more of Northern Ireland but I might just have to save that for the next trip when I rent a car. Thanks in advance!



Edit:sorry for the formatting D: it’s my first time posting with lists/bullet points and sometimes it enters to the next line and sometimes it doesn’t!?","I hadn’t thought of private busses. I’m wondering if that would be an option for going to Cliffs of Moher from Galway. I’ll look into that.

As for Portmagee, I contacted my Airbnb host before booking and they said I can do public transport from Cork to Caherciveen and they can arrange to pick me up from there so I’m grateful for that.

Thanks for the Kinsale recommendation, I’ll add it to my list!"
Visiting Ireland without a car,"Hello,

I want to visit Ireland this year, I wanna stay there for about 10 days and I'd really like to make the best of it (in terms of visiting as many places as possible). I do not have a drivers' license, and I have read diverse opinions on public transport viability for this purpose. I will be also solo traveling - if that is relevant in any way.

Can you give me some advice? Can I do this by train? Are there other/better alternatives? I am totally fine with trains, I am just not sure it is a good idea.","Buses will get you more places tbh.

It is doable. It just takes planning. There may be some specific place that you absolutely want to go to but it'd be too much hassle by public transport, once you accept that and adapt your plan you'll be fine. Day tours for some of the top places to see also exist"

There are many independent bus route operators who run one or two lines, and Rome2Rio will point them out to you (as well as the Irish Rail and Bus Eireann routes).

Belfast has the best city transit system in Ireland (they have buses, bus rapid transit, and trains). Cork City has a commuter rail line line that connects Midleton and Cobh. Limerick City has a decent bus network, and is fairly close to Shannon Airport. Dublin has commuter rail and the Luas tram system, but only buses running to the airport. The city has a lot of traffic jams which slow down the buses and trams."

We visited Dublin in the past years so this time we decided to focus the trip on different areas, with a preference for outdoor activities. We chose Killarney National Park, the Dingle peninsula, Aran Islands and the Cliff of Moher as destinations and we searched for the best way to go from one to the other with public transportation.

\-Buy train tickets well in advance, as the tickets get more expensive in the days before and very expensive the day of departure.

\-Some buses only take credit card, so make sure you have a popular brand like MasterCard or Visa, preferably without international fees.

\-Some buses only take exact change, like the local buses in Dublin. (The Luas light rail takes credit card though.)

\-Buses departing from major cities like Dublin and Galway will depart right on time. Buses arriving/departing from small villages could be hours late. I waited for 4 hours for my bus in Adare -\_-

"Suggestions / Thoughts on an itinerary, please","Hello, my friend & I (35F) are planning a trip to Ireland (and Scotland) for the end of August/beginning of September. 

We need help planning an itinerary. We currently have two ideas and cannot decide what to do. 

Our main issue is we will not have a car. Being from the US, we do not feel comfortable driving in Ireland. 

Idea #1
We will fly into Dublin & spend a few days there. From Dublin, we will go to Galway for a few days (via train) and do a day tour to the Cliffs of Moher. Finally, we will spend a couple of nights at Dromoland Castle. Leave from Shannon Airport. 

Idea #2
We will fly into Dublin & the spend the first part of our trip there. From Dublin, we will go to Dromoland Castle (via train or bus) for the second half of the trip and do a day tour to the Cliffs of Moher. Leave from Shannon Airport. 

I’ve been reading a lot of your tips and many of you have suggested to station in two cities, so we are not sure if we should skip Galway and simply split our time between Dublin and Dromoland.  

Based on your suggestions in other threads, these are some of the things we hope to see/do:

- Dublin Castle
- Christ Church Cathedral 
- St. Patrick’s Cathedral
- Guinness Storehouse
- Trinity College / Book of Kells
- Grafton Street 
- Iveagh Gardens
- St. Stephen’s Green
- Ha’penny Bridge
- Temple Bar district
- EPIC
- Day tour to Glendalough 
- Falconry/Hawk Walk (at Dromoland)

I realize there’s so much more to see, but don’t want to spread ourselves to thin. 

Any suggestions at all (hotels, transportation, restaurants, etc) is welcome & greatly appreciated!","Thank you! We having been looking up rail/bus so your input is much appreciated.

Ennis is very close though, could get taxi in and then bus to cliffs and back. 

The Road to the cliffs is windy but it's not the worst road at all. take it handy and you'll be there easy enough. Dromoland to Lahinch is main road and not narrow.
If you drove and fancied ut you could spin down into Doolin after cliffs and get a boat to see the cliffs from below... easily doable in a day( I've done it with a lunch stop).

Shannon is a superb airport and a taxi ride from Dromoland also.

traveling to dublin from the 2nd to the 5th,"hello! traveling to dublin from the 2-5 of january and am seeking some advice on two things:

second, where are some good places to take a day trip by train or public transportation? its my boyfriend and i's first time in ireland and we want to try to see as much as we can. we have the whole day of the second and the fourth to see dublin, but wanted to use the third for a day trip. thoughts?

thank you in advance!

\- It's just the two of us, no kids

\- Traveling from Chicago

\- Planning to stay for about a week with our ""home base"" being Dublin, and probably heading out to Galway for two overnights (one full day)

\- Interests include: food, history, ancient ruins, whiskey, exploring less-touristy areas that locals might be more likely to frequent

\- Of note: I am gluten intolerant, so beer and bread are off limits unfortunately.

While you can't drink beer, there are whiskey distilleries in Dublin that you can tour (and sample).

As for off the beaten path destinations that locals go to, well a lot of them will be off the beaten track for public transport too, but in Dublin, look at taking the Dart out along the coastline and doing the Bray to Greystones walk, or out to the Vico Baths in Killiney. 

The Phoenix Park is worth a wander too - a lot of locals come here when the weather is good. There are free tours of  Aras an Uachtarain (where the Irish President lives) most Saturdays, tickets are on a first come, first served basis though."

You're definitely not missing anything in Sligo, as you'll need a car to get to any of the worthwhile attractions.

>Day 6 - Travel to Achill Island. Will have to switch buses in Claremorris

If you're taking the Derry to Galway bus, you could stop off in Charlestown instead of Claremorris and get the Athlone to Westport bus. From there, I think there's a Go Bus to Achill.

Achill is a little difficult without a car. During the summer, there are shuttle buses from Keel to Keem Bay. If the weather is decent, you could take a walk from Dooagh to the Deserted Village. 

If Kylemore Abbey tickets are included in the day tour then go for it, as they're one of the most expensive in the country (twice the price of the Cliffs of Moher) and the gardens/buildings are a little disappointing. I would prefer Pine Island or even up to Cong instead for a day."

Hikes reachable by public transport,"I'm looking to solo-travel in Ireland this summer. I've looked at different hikes I'm interested in, and made a travel plan accordingly, only to realise that many of them are only reachable by car, or like 3+ hours with public means. 😊

Do anyone have any suggestions on hikes that are reachable by public transport, or by renting a bike or so. Or hikes a walking distance from towns? It feels like so many of the hikes I find is so far out, and it's discouraging to see that photos of amazing nature only to realise that I won't be able to reach it. ☹️

I'll fly to Dublin, and would like to visit the Aran Islands, Galway and Cork. Other than that I'm pretty open.  One of the hikes will work out at least! I found the ""Cliffs of Moher Coastal Walk"" between Doolin and Liscannor, and am very much looking forward to it 😊

Thankfull for any help!

Edit:
Initially I had looked to take this route:
Dublin
Sligo
Galway
Aran islands
Doolin - Liscannor (Lahinch)
Killarney
Cork
Tipperary 
Dublin","It's a tricky one to get to the best hikes with no car but I'll make a fer wildly different suggestions.

The Comeragh Mountains: 40 mins on the bus from Waterford City, you can stay in the Comeragh pods https://via.eviivo.com/ComeraghPodsX42

Explore Mahon Falls, Coumshinaghan, the Waterford Greenway etc. 

St Declans Way: Five day mini camino type trail From Ardmore to Cashel, lots of towns to stay in along the way, most will be accessible 

Sligo: if you rent a bike in Sligo you can cycle to a few good hikes, including Benbulbin.

Online hiking group: there are lots of open hiking groups that organise walks and car pooling on weekends;

Hiking buddies ireland is a popular nationwide one. 

Slieve Hiking on instagram is based in the south east.

Have a look around fb/instagram and see are there any local ones in the towns you're staying.

Dublin hiking group: this crowd run buses every Sunday morning from Dublin to a different hike. http://hillwalkersclub.com/upcoming-hikes/

Happy hiking."
Hikes reachable by public transport,"I'm looking to solo-travel in Ireland this summer. I've looked at different hikes I'm interested in, and made a travel plan accordingly, only to realise that many of them are only reachable by car, or like 3+ hours with public means. 😊

Do anyone have any suggestions on hikes that are reachable by public transport, or by renting a bike or so. Or hikes a walking distance from towns? It feels like so many of the hikes I find is so far out, and it's discouraging to see that photos of amazing nature only to realise that I won't be able to reach it. ☹️

I'll fly to Dublin, and would like to visit the Aran Islands, Galway and Cork. Other than that I'm pretty open.  One of the hikes will work out at least! I found the ""Cliffs of Moher Coastal Walk"" between Doolin and Liscannor, and am very much looking forward to it 😊

Thankfull for any help!

Edit:
Initially I had looked to take this route:
Dublin
Sligo
Galway
Aran islands
Doolin - Liscannor (Lahinch)
Killarney
Cork
Tipperary 
Dublin","Will you just fly to Dublin? Or are you planning to spend some time there? You could make some day trips, and use public transport for it. Some options are Malahide to Portmarnock Coastal Walk, Howth cliff walk, Great South Wall Walk and maybe even something like Donabate to Portrane Cliff Walk."
Let’s try this again. (Itinerary advice please!),"Hey all,

Thanks to the folks that helped me realize how jam packed my original itinerary was. I left some vital info out in my summarized itinerary before. I’ve made some changes and I’ve decided to mostly anchor myself in Dublin and in Galway, making day trips from each to avoid transferring hotels too often and to simplify things. I’m traveling solo as well, so I’ll enjoy opps to meet others and do a few things alone.

For reference, I’ll be traveling using public transport (buses, trains, taxis, etc). I am using a day tour to get from Dublin to Galway. 

I will primarily be taking group or bus tours as well as ferry.

I’ll miss Blarney Stone+Castle, but I’m happy to return to Ireland and visit it the next round! Please make recommendations on good food, coffee, and pubs. I probably won’t visit distilleries or do whiskey tasting as I’m more partial to beer.

I’d also appreciate hostel, b&b, and hotel recs for Dublin and Galway! I intend to splurge more in Galway as I’ll be spending my birthday there.

Thanks in advance for your help!

Here’s my schedule: 

Friday 6/14:	Redeye flight. Arrive at 8:45AM in Dublin, train/bus/taxi to hotel, checkin, regroup, self guided tour or free walking tour thru Dublin with a coffee and snack, Book of kells and Dublin castle express booking at 3pm, then find a pub and eat and drink, overnight in Dublin.

Saturday 6/15: 	Bus day tour! Start early AM - Giants causeway/antrim coast/dunluce castle/belfast black cab tour from dublin, dinner and overnight in Dublin

Sunday 6/16:	Travel to Galway using Galway bus tour day trip from Dublin. This tour stops at Dungaire Castle and also the Cliffs of Moher. Dip out before they go back to Dublin. Drop off stuff at hotel then explore the city, Latin quarter. Eat dinner. Overnight Galway

Monday 6/17: 	Day trip to Inis Mor using ferry from Galway. Use e-bike to get around on the island, lunch here and see the wormhole, Dun aengus, etc. ferry back at 6pm. Dinner and Overnight in Galway.

Tuesday 6/18:	Day trip (bus tour) from Galway to Connemara and Kylemore Abbey! Dine and overnight again in Galway.

Wednesday 6/19: 	Travel back to Dublin via train, ~2-3 hr ride. Check in to hotel. Shop around in town or go find any live music available, if up for it, go pub crawl and overnight here. Rest up and prep for flight home.

Thursday 6/20: 	Head to Airport (taxi/bus). Fly home from Dublin airport!","As others have said, i'd cut out Northern Ireland from this trip. The Antrim coast and Giant's Causeway is great, but that will be rushed at BEST, and at worst will be too fast of a day to see anything at all, especially if you plan to sight see Belfast and take a Black Cab tour (which i HIGHLY recommend as it was our TOP thing we did in Belfast.).

But as others have said: Leave Northern Ireland for the next trip.

I'd also make a couple other edits, and I have aded suggestions:

1. Dublin: Since you will hopefully nix Northern Ireland, you'll now have 2 days in Dublin. When I was there in July/August we did this:
   1. Day1: St. Stephens Green->Grafton St -> Trinity College with Tour and Book of Kells-> Temple Bar District, skipped the pubs here to find non-touristy ones later -> River and crossed the Ha Penny Bridge->O'Connell Street and the Post Office (do some pre-trip reading on Dublins history to have an idea of the importance of the Post Office and other sights on O'Connell)->pubs;
   2. Day 2: Dublin Castle, tour->Christ Church, self tour->Dublinia (i'd probably opt for the Archaeology Museum but I have kids and they enjoyed this more)->St. Patrick's Cathedral->Guinness Storehouse->Brazen Head pub and a pub crawl if you didn't yesterday. Consider the following:
      1. O’Donaghues Bar, 
      2. Mulligans Pub, 
      3. The Palace Bar, 
      4. Temple Bar ( i know i said the bars in Temple Bar district were more touristy, but it's worth a expensive pint to say you were here as a tourist)
      5. Brazen Head
2. Galway - not much to edit/reco. Galway is a fun walk through (start at Eyre Square, walk through the pedestrian streets, grab a fish & chips at O'Donagh's (spelling?) and stop at the Spanish Arch. Enjoy the street vendors and performers. maybe grab a pint at king's head or other pub We did love the drink concoctions made at the Galway Distillery Co. and enjoyed walking in Salt Hill along the beach/promenade.
3. I know some people are reco'ing AGAINST conemarra and Kylemore abbey, but we loved both and I highly recommend. If nothing else just seeing Kylemore from the outside in its setting was worth it. The region is great.
4. Inis Mor! This was one of my favorite days of our 17 day trip. I tried HARD to find a place to stay on the island, but i was last minute and there during their busiest time of year. BUT, you can definitely see a lot with a full day trip like you have planned. Hop on the first ferry to the islands (9ish i think).
   1. As soon as you arrive, walk the 200 yards to the bike rental spot and get an E-bike (I got a pedal bike b/c i enjoy cycling my son got an e-bike, and their bikes are NOT the same as my racing bike at home and i hard a much harder time keeping up with my son than i like to admit). Make sure the bike has a little basket. 
   2. Stop at the nearby grocery store for snacks and drinks for a picnic lunch. 
   3. Head up the ""high/main"" road towards Seven Sisters Church (if you want to save time or did not get an E-bike, skip this location). 
   4. Then head to Dun Angus fort. 
   5. Then head to the Worm's hole. This was hard to find so hopefully you see people walking to or from it when you finally find the spot to leave your bikes - keep an eye out for the SMALL signpost pointing to the road to the worm hole on the way to Dun Angus and back. Careful on the rocks to the worm hole - this is NOT the place for flip flops or sandals! 
   6. Take the ""low"" road back near the beach and along the water. You'll have a chance to see a seal colony sun bathing on the nearby rocks.
   7. Make sure to be back to Joe Watty's pub for a final pint and mabe food before the final ferry leaves at 4:30 (i think). Sit at the bar. Talk to any locals there or the bar keep. Maybe meet Grace, the owner. This was definitely a highlight of our trip - the local men and Grace told us stories of the island and history. I bought them a round, they bought us a flight of whiskey. Many laughs were had and they promised to put me up if they made me miss our ferry back. They were great people - friendly and warm and kind and funny. 
   8. Assuming you make the ferry, you'll be back to Galway around 6p (i think. we took the Doolin ferry and i am not sure if there is a difference in travel times).

As others have said, don't try to pack too much in BUT if you do keep the places you have included AND do cut Northern Ireland, the above edits/suggestions should help out a bit.

Have a great trip!"

The giants causeway tour is far less walking and activity, but far more bus time. Granted, I’ll be able to doze off on the bus."

I have posted this from another post of mine to tell you how go to the Giants causeway using the public transport system

hi there, yes you can go to the Giants causeway from Belfast by Bus and train below i will outline how to do this  
  
go to either Great Victoria Street Train station on Great Victoria St Belfast this is combined with europa bus station its in the same building  
  
Get a Train going to Londonderry-Derry, after 1 hour of a train journey get off the Train in COLERAINE  
  
go into the combined train and bus station in Coleraine come off the train down the steps turn left past the coffee shop and walk to the very end of the station this is where the bus departs from you will see a bus departure screen telling you what Gate you get the bus from you then get the Ulsterbus 402 service to Ballycastle this stops at the Giants causeway, the public transport company in Northern Ireland is ""Translink"" (www.translink.co.uk  
) ticket wise if you purchase a £17.50 Zone 4 ""I-link"" card this will give you unlimited travel anywhere on the bus or train anywhere in Northern Ireland you purchase this at the train station ticket office :)

Remember you will need UK Pounds for Northern ireland not euro"

Spend the full day in Belfast, do the Black taxi tour, and go to the Titanic museum.  

And  full day in Killarney, if the day is nice hire a bike, you can do cycle the lake, go out to the waterfall.

Things to keep in mind while planning a vacation to Ireland,"So as the title says, I'm looking into things I should plan in advance for a vacation to Ireland next year. It will be for a week in September of 2023 barring unseen events. I've never traveled out of the US before, so I'm trying to make sure I don't miss anything in my planning stage. Is there anything I should particularly avoid in terms of transportation and where to stay? What would you all say are the ""must-see"" attractions? Would it be wise to plan around a couple of hubs and do day trips from those throughout the week? Is renting a car worth it? Is the matchmaking festival that usually goes on in Lisdoonvarna worth checking out? Any tips that you may offer would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!","Hi! Ireland was my first time out of the country also and it was a wonderful experience! Free now is an app you can download to call a cab, we also used trains, and busses. We took a can from the airport to our hotel. When in Dublin we primarily used the Luas which was nice and not too expensive. It's pretty readily available most times of the day. If you're in Dublin I would not get a rental car, it's busy and you don't really need it imo because public transportation and walking will pretty much get you anywhere. Renting a car is worth it if you're leaving Dublin because then you have freedom to see whatever you want. We were there for two weeks and saw Dublin/also took a bus to Howth which was beautiful, northern Ireland (giants causeway), Galway, Doolin, and Dingle. I personally really enjoyed the smaller towns like Doolin and Dingle because they're more quiet, and the live music was wonderful there. Everywhere is stunning in Ireland and I feel like no matter where you go you won't be missing out because there's a lot to see, and a lot to experience. Everyone was so kind and welcoming which I loved.

Best of luck! No matter what you do, you're going to have an experience you will never forget!! ❤️"
12 nights in October,"Hello! I’ve already learned a lot of what I wanted from other posts which is fantastic but still have a few questions about our upcoming trip.

We’re a group of 5 from the US (ages: ~30 & 65+). It’s everyone’s 1st time visiting Ireland. Below is our itinerary:

10/18: Land in Dublin early morning. Drive rentals cars to Galway. 
10/18 - 10/22: Galway
10/22 - 10/24: Goleen
10/24 - 10/27: Cork
10/27 - 10/29: Belfast
10/29 - 10/30: Dublin

We have tickets to the jazz festival in Cork, a ballet in Belfast, and tickets to the Gobbins Cliff Path. We haven’t booked anything else because most the group wanted to be able to decide activities day of and be spontaneous. 

However, I’m kinda nervous about this. I’m spontaneous but I hate missing out on something I wanted to do because of poor planning. We all want to do a boat trip to whale watch… is this something best to book in advance?

My boyfriend and I are thinking about buying tickets to a show at Ulster Hall in Belfast. As tourists, would this be ok or is this not a good area to see a show if you’re not local? We’ve heard mixed opinions on Belfast from people who have been. Some allude to it not being very safe while others say they loved it and felt everyone was friendly. 

Are the cities we’re visiting easy to get around with cars or is it better to utilize taxis and public transportation?

Thank you all in advance! 😊

ETA: Got our tickets for the show at Ulster! Thank you all for your advice.

I don't know who on Earth told you Belfast wasn't safe because that's utter nonsense.... or *_complete ballix_* as we would say lol.

Of course buy tickets for a show in the Ulster Hall - there's no issue.

Belfast has an extensive Metro bus service along with the Glider bus."

ETA: Got our tickets for the show at Ulster! Thank you all for your advice. Excited to be in Ireland next week!!","Its a good idea to go see a show. The Ulster Hall is behind (south) of the city hall, there is some on-street parking which is free after 6pm. Before that either use the JustPark app or put coins in the meter. 
FYI, in front (north) of the city hall is a pedestrian shopping area. 

Multi storey car parks are a bit more expensive than the on-strret parking.

Beware some lanes are bus lanes during mon-sat 7am-7pm, don't drive in these or the automatic cameras will catch you.

The people in Belfast are friendly, but the accent is more harsh and appears less friendly than the rolling tones of the Dublin accent. A native Cork accent is a whole different matter, something to be experienced! 

There is good public transport within Belfast but you'll need a car to get to the Gobbins visitor centre.

While in Belfast, you may want to take a hop on hop off bus that brings you to the places of interest, and see Belfast Castle, the peace walls etc."

ETA: Got our tickets for the show at Ulster! Thank you all for your advice. Excited to be in Ireland next week!!","I can only comment on Galway, Cork, and Dublin but they are easy to get around without a car if you are staying in the city or driving in and parking. Most people will especially recommend no car in Dublin. You can walk most places in 25 minutes or less. The busses and tram in Dublin are pretty easy (just make sure you flag the bus or it will drive by and know that the tracker on google backs sometimes says your bus already left but is wrong) and you can get a leap card at any Spar or Centra or pay exact change. Taxis are expensive and not much faster if you’re traveling within the city. 

I’d personally recommend finding reasonably priced parking close to the city if you’re staying somewhere that isn’t walkable and parking for the day. Or take a bus into town if you’re near a bus stop. 

Galway has the most reasonably priced car parks of those three. 

I’m the same with planning. I want flexibility but don’t want to miss stuff. I usually check tickets for the next 1-2 days on the day of the week I would be going (a couple of weeks before) to get an idea of how booked the experience gets. If I notice they are selling out, I’ll go ahead and book. If they have a bunch of times/tickets left, I feel better about last minute plans. I don’t know if I explained that very well but that method seems to work for me."

Are the cities we’re visiting easy to get around with cars or is it better to utilize taxis and public transportation?

Thank you all in advance! 😊

ETA: Got our tickets for the show at Ulster! Thank you all for your advice. Excited to be in Ireland next week!!","What ..... all those long distances - you're trusting Google for driving times? Fine, but you need to be aware that Google only bases its calculations on the speed limits of the roads in question. It doesn't take into consideration other traffic, delays caused by farm traffic (cattle on roads, tractors, slurry trailers, trucks, etc.) or other issues (tourist traffic, accidents, funerals, construction work). You need to allow a LOT more time than Google indicates for such incidents, and of course you'll want to stop and take pictures and stretch the legs along the way too. I mean, you could take the motorway from Cork city to Dublin and then on to Belfast, but you'll miss so much along the way. 

Frankly this is MUCH too spread out. You want to visit Ulster AND Cork? Why so much driving?"
12 nights in October,"Hello! I’ve already learned a lot of what I wanted from other posts which is fantastic but still have a few questions about our upcoming trip.

We’re a group of 5 from the US (ages: ~30 & 65+). It’s everyone’s 1st time visiting Ireland. Below is our itinerary:

10/18: Land in Dublin early morning. Drive rentals cars to Galway. 
10/18 - 10/22: Galway
10/22 - 10/24: Goleen
10/24 - 10/27: Cork
10/27 - 10/29: Belfast
10/29 - 10/30: Dublin

We have tickets to the jazz festival in Cork, a ballet in Belfast, and tickets to the Gobbins Cliff Path. We haven’t booked anything else because most the group wanted to be able to decide activities day of and be spontaneous. 

However, I’m kinda nervous about this. I’m spontaneous but I hate missing out on something I wanted to do because of poor planning. We all want to do a boat trip to whale watch… is this something best to book in advance?

Advice for upcoming trip from US to Ireland,"This will be my first time in Ireland so im looking for any and all advice/tips. I am to get a tattoo done by an artist in Dublin during May and again in June to finish. So far I have only booked a round trip flight into Dublin for a suprisingly low rate ($470). Unfortunately the rates sky rocketed back to what I'm assuming is normal for the trip ($900-1k)? If you have any flight price hacks please let me know. I will be gone for a week in May and debating if I'll make my trip longer for June depending how May goes. 

- Is it worth it to hire a travel agent? I've never done it so I'm not sure what to expect if I did. 

- Currency:  Is it cheaper to convert USD to Euros in the states or in Ireland? I have to pay the artist in cash. Where do I do this? 

- Transportation: I don't plan to rent a car as it sounds terrifying to switch my brain to drive on the opposite side I'm used to, so I plan to stay in Dublin the whole time and use the bus and taxi system. The obvious drawback to this is lack of independence to go where I please. I was thinking of buying into the day trips to tourist destinations like The Cliffs of Moher. 

- What are the must sees/dos in Dublin and Ireland in general? Want to get as much of an authentic experience as one can. Any local spots worth a visit? Food/drink? 

- Where to stay? I'd like to stay close to downtown Dublin for under $120.

- Any covid restrictions? I am vaxed and getting my booster soon.","Been there 5 times. Don’t really need a travel agent. I usually just do some online research. I like the Rick Steves guidebooks. Cheapest way to get euros is just to use an atm. Make sure your bank card will work in Ireland, most do. Make sure that your bank doesn’t charge fees for foreign currency. Dublin is a very walkable city and they have Uber along with a decent rail system that goes around the city. The bus system goes much anywhere. The train system only seems to go to major cities (www.irishrail.ie) many places have WiFi, Dublin is a pretty modern city, the country side not so much. Although my favorite parts of Ireland is the west (Dingle, Galway, Cobh, Cork,,Sligo) there are plenty of places in Dublin that do day bus tours to the ring of Kerry, Belfast, etc…..Temple bar is very tourist heavy. If you want to see the real Ireland just go to a small town and walk into a random pub, you’ll make friends in no time. Irish are very friendly and will talk to you. They love a good conversation. If you have Amazon prime watch the movie The Irish Pub, gives you an idea of the culture and ideas for what pubs to check out. 
  Live music is plentiful. Most pubs have live traditional music with no cover. 

Any questions, let me know"
First Time in Ireland Itinerary ~11 days - Semi Solo,"Hello all!

This will be my first time traveling to Ireland and also doing some solo travel.  A buddy of mine is getting married in Doolin in June so there will be a few days I am with the bigger wedding group but would also like to branch out and see some sights. I am working on broad strokes of an itinerary but am open to changing really anything.  I'd love some feedback/advice! I honestly am not sure what to do with my last couple of days. 

I have nothing in particular that is a must see, but from an interest's perspective I'd love to experience Ireland's music, food & landscapes. I am fairly active/fit so hiking/active days aren't out of the question. 

I arrive in Dublin in the early morning of June 24th (overnight flight from eastern US) and leave in the afternoon on July 4th. 

Note:

* Most of the wedding attendees will be getting there a couple days after me. So, I figured I'd push myself to do some solo travel and start in the west before meeting up with them in Doolin. 
* My plan kind of takes me back and forth between east/west but since its all-public transport I don't know if it will be too bad. It's also to hang with the wedding party. 
* I'd prefer not to rent a car by myself.

Day 1 - Saturday June 24th - Galway

* Arrive in Dublin early AM, catch bus to train station, head to Galway
* Arrive in Galway by midday, explore the city, nightlife, etc. 
* Stay at an Airbnb or a hotel, undecided

Day 2 - Sunday, June 25th - Galway

* Take a day tour out of Galway to Connemara? 
* Back to Galway for nightlife/sleep

Day 3 - Monday, June 26th - Galway

* No set plans, any suggestions? any day trips or advice to jump somewhere else?

Day 4 - Tuesday, June 27th - Doolin 

* Take bus #350 from Galway down to Doolin to meet up with rest of wedding party
* try and get there early, might do doolin cave, burren walk, pitch and putt
* night pre-wedding dinner with wedding party

Day 5 - Wednesday, June 28th - Doolin 

* nothing planned for the daytime
* evening - wedding @ cliffs of moher, dinner, reception

Day 6 - Thursday, June 29th - Dublin

* Wedding has a party bus going back to Dublin, will travel with group
* Doing Guinness and dinner Thursday night 

Day 7 - Friday, June 30th - Dublin 

* Day trip to Northern Ireland via tour
* see Belfast, giant causeway, etc. 

Day 8 - Saturday, July 1st - ??? 

* was thinking maybe take train from Dublin > Mallow > Kerry and seeing the Gap of Dunloe
* Alternatively, I could travel south of Dublin to somewhere like Wicklow or Glendalough 

Day 9 - Sunday, July 2nd - ??? - any suggestions? 

Day 10 - Monday, July 3rd - ??? - any suggestions? 

Day 11 - Tuesday, July 4th - Dublin

Thank you!","I went to Inis Oirr as a solo traveller. I stayed there overnight. It's the smallest island so it's easy to get around. They have horse and trap tours as well as bike hires. I think there is also bus tours as well. And there were plenty of pubs, cafes and restaurants. Inish Mór which is the biggest Island has lots to do as well. From what I have heard Inis Mór is more developed than the other islands. Inis Mean is the middle one and not as popular as the other two. You can go for the day or stay overnight on them."

Thank you!","Yes! Deffo great places to visit regarding public transport. Ireland's public transport isn't the best, but as someone who also navigates Ireland via public transport, I've found these two places easy to get to by using only public transport. Wexford has a direct bus to it from Dublin, but Dun Laoghaire especially is the perfect day out by using public transport. The train is superb and quick, and you get a lovely view of the sea whilst on it, plus 5 euro for a return ticket is pretty grand! Along with it being a short journey means you can do more in your day. Safe travels!"

Trains and buses - booking ahead vs there?,"Going to Ireland for ten days and planning to use public transportation. How imperative is it to buy ahead and how far ahead does it need to be? Like two months or a day?

We want to hit several cities but it's just a little strange to think about making such a specific itinerary (leave from this station at 2:25 on Tuesday) cause then I you're just planning your days around the transportation, as opposed to, ""we're gonna explore, eat, and then when we're ready to leave we'll hop on a train or bus to the next place""

If the first approach is just how things are there (or on any int'l trip), that will be fine of course, I just need someone to confirm if that's actually what needs to happen. Thank you! 


Also while I'm here... Four cities in nine days, with an average train ride of four hours to get to each -- is that going to feel like we're spending our whole trip traveling instead of enjoying the place? Dublin, Belfast, Galway, and Cork are the goals.","We booked train ticket from Galway to Athenry the morning of. It's cheaper if you book online and then print your tickets at the train station. We took Gobus from Dublin to Galway and back, and booked ahead  which is the best idea, because they were fully booked (excellent service, by the way). 
The DART service out of Dublin, we didn't book ahead and paid with our visitor LEAP cards ( don't forget to buy one at the airport). DART will take you to the very cool villages outside of Dublin, on the coast.
Probably from city to city, it's a good idea to book a day or so ahead online, whether it's train or Gobus or Citylink. Also  bus 350 from Galway to the Cliffs of Moher gets busy, so buy that ticket a day ahead too.
And yes, you might want to eliminate one city from your plans. Like you say, you don't want to spend so much time travelling.
We had a great time on the public transportation, I hope you enjoy it!"

Need itinerary advice - beginning planning stages of a 8 to 9 day trip in early October,"Hello Kind Strangers!

My (35F) husband (36M) and I are planning a trip to Ireland in late September / early October for our 5-year wedding anniversary.

We are not very comfortable with driving on the left so we are leaning towards public transport such as bus or rail. We are just starting to plan out our trip and are wanting some tips from experienced folk. 

On our list, we're especially interested in popular attractions like Cliffs of Moher, Trinity College, etc. But we'd also like to see We think spending 2 to 3 days in a city makes sense, then moving on to the next. We want to see as much as possible while still enjoying ourselves and not feeling rushed. 

Our interests include visiting distilleries/breweries, scenic routes and historic tours, wool and fiber arts such as knitting spinning, and weaving. We are also into light to moderate hiking and really want to have an immersive experience. We are moderately social and are well-seasoned travelers, just mostly in the US. 

So my questions for the group:

* Is driving on the left really a big deal? We are 90% decided on not renting a car, but I'm interested in hearing others' thoughts. Will we miss out on beautiful scenery etc by going with PT?
* Can anyone direct me to sample itineraries that are solid and reliable? I'm new to this sub so apologies if this is asked frequently. 
* Any can't miss towns or attractions? 

Thanks!","Public transportation is fine with the major cities, but very sporadic in the smaller towns and rural areas, and that's where I've always considered the heart of Ireland to be located.

Driving on the left wasn't bad at all. Rental cars usually have stickers on the windshield, reminding you. Because the driver is on the right side of the car, just remember that the driver is still next to the median of the road. 
For me, the bigger issue is Ireland's narrow, twisting roads. But most of the best scenes in Ireland require driving a mile down a two-way road barely wide enough for one car. I just take it slow, and if I come across another car, I pull over wherever I can, as far as I can, and just stop. I let the other driver go around me.

If you fly into Dublin, I'd recommend spending two full days there. You definitely don't need a car there."

We are also into light to moderate hiking and really want to have an immersive experience. We are moderately social and are well-seasoned travelers, just mostly in the US. 

So my questions for the group:

* Is driving on the left really a big deal? We are 90% decided on not renting a car, but I'm interested in hearing others' thoughts. Will we miss out on beautiful scenery etc by going with PT?
* Can anyone direct me to sample itineraries that are solid and reliable? I'm new to this sub so apologies if this is asked frequently. 
* Any can't miss towns or attractions? 

Thanks!","I had similar concerns but reversed, coming from Ireland and renting a car in Greece. I found the changeover much easier than expected, though with a few minor mistakes. You should be fine after your first day on the other side. It really helps to have someone in the passenger seat spotting signs and hazards and flagging them to you on the first couple of days, as you (the driver) will spend more time fixating on your immediate surroundings. After a while though muscle memory kicks in and it's just like driving back at home. 

It's true that seeing the best of the countryside means turning down very narrow roads, which can be particularly daunting if coming from the US with it's generally much wider road network. But you just take it slow and easy and pull into the nearest farm gate if there's an oncoming tractor!

If you use public transport, you'd be fine in places like Dublin and Cork. And Galway can just be walked around really. Outside these towns, public transport is reliable in getting you to major tourist attractions. However, there are countless lesser known but equally great sights that would be more difficult to get to. Not impossible, you'd just need more planning and much more time. There are plenty of bus tour companies that would offer several sights in one day that might be handy if you want to get out of the towns but aren't comfortable driving.

As for can't-miss towns / attractions... It depends on what you like and where you're aiming geographically. The usual towns that are heavily visited are Cork and Galway. Cork City is great and Cork County has some incredibly beautiful landscapes, with plenty of attractions in short distance from the city, like Charles Fort in Kinsale, Cobh or Spike Island.

Further north, places like Sligo, Leitrim and Donegal have some breathtaking landscapes (e.g. Sliabh Liag). And nearby Co. Mayo has some beautiful spots that are less visited than others on the Atlantic coast. Many are best visited by car.

If you're looking inland, you have great towns like Kilkenny and Cashel (the Rock of Cashel is a must-see if possible). You can do cruises along the R. Shannon, or take a ferry out to some Islands off the West coast. All of these are easily facilitated by public transport.

For breweries & hiking, a car is generally best. However you can get public transport to places like the Wicklow Wolf brewery, where you're also at the foot of the Wicklow Uplands where there are countless hiking routes, just outside Dublin. For distilleries, you have Roe & Co and the Jameson distilleries in Dublin (the latter is a major tourist attraction), then maybe Tullamore distillery in Co. Offaly in the midlands, and several others around the country."

Thanks!","Driving on the left isn’t too bad, and it only takes a short time to get used to it. I’ve been to Ireland 5 times and have rented a car for 4 of those trips. Most of my time has been in the west, on the Dingle peninsula, so the roads are usually narrower. In my experience, the other drivers are a lot less aggressive than in the US, and I didn’t find the smaller roads to be a problem.

If you’re interested in hiking, there is a lot on both the Dingle and Iveragh peninsulas in Kerry. I visited the Gap of Dunloe for the first time on my latest trip, and it was as spectacular as I’d hoped. There are numerous trails off the gap road that climb the mountains; we stuck to the road this time but will probably return to hit the trails. In Dingle, you can walk from town to a path that follows the southeast curve of the harbor to Hussey’s Folly and the lighthouse. If you continue on this trail, you can go to Beenbawn beach and beyond. There is another great trail just past the fire station that goes up to Cnoc a Cairn, where you can get amazing views of Dingle town and harbor. One branch of this trail goes all the way up to Conor Pass.

I’m obviously biased toward Kerry, but Dingle has both a brewery at Dick Mack’s and the Dingle Distillery has a fun tour. To the south, the Ring of Kerry is incredible, and has places like the Cill Rialaig Art Center and amazing scenery. 

Happy anniversary!"
My Ireland travel itinerary for June (16 days),"Dear All,

I will travel through Ireland in June for 16 days. While the amount of time sounds long, I also like to take my time at a place, do day trips and don't like ticking checkboxes on a bucket list. I will also use public transport, as I'm not a confident driver.

So this is the plan, and I would like to know if this plan sounds good or if I missed great highlights:

4 days Dublin
4 days Galway
4 days Killarney
2 days Cork
1 day Kilkenny
1 day (preparing to got home) Dublin

I left out Sligo and Limerick, because I think there will be plenty of possibilities to do day trips from Galway. Killarney, I think, will be a great place to do some bicycle trips. 

What do you think about Cork and Kilkenny?

Thanks a lot in advance!","Why doesn't anyone go to County Donegal? Amazing scenery, Glenveagh, Slieve League, Fanad Head, and maybe stay in Letterkenny. Maybe the limitation is public transportation to these spots?"
Tips about Bus Eireann 275 (Tralee - Dingle) and 350 (Ennis - Doolin),"Hello everyone! My girlfriend and I are planning 10-days trip to Ireland in August. We'll use public transport because cars are way more expensive for that period. We have already booked all our trains and now we would like to also book the buses from Tralee to Dingle (and return) and from Ennis to Doolin (one way). When we select the tickets on the Bus Eireann site we can't reserve the seats for those two services (275 and 350).

Do you know if there is any other way to reserve a seat on those buses? If there is no way to reserve the seats I think the only way to be sure to have a seat is to arrive in advance.

In your opinion those two services (275 Tralee - Dingle of 9AM, 275 Dingle - Tralee of 7:30 PM and 350 Ennis - Doolin of 5:30 or 6:30 PM) could be very crowded in the first week of august? How much time in advance do you suggest arriving at bus stations to be sure to find a seat?

The train is a **much** better option to Galway, you'll be able to book online at irishrail.ie and reserve a seat so you don't have to worry about late buses.

I'd recommend a day in Cork if you have a day to spare,  lots to see and do, Titanic Experience, and Deck of Houses in Cobh. Blarney Castle not too far either if you want to follow the footsteps of countless Americans."

Pick one or the other - I'd suggest spending your first full day in Galway city. I'd be reluctant to plan a definite trip to the Aran Islands because in February weather conditions could cause it to be cancelled. I would spend 2 nights in Galway at least. 

Check that bus to the Cliffs of Moher - might not be running in the low season. It might be better to join a tour, you can contact the tourist office in Galway about that, or try [www.discoverireland.ie](https://www.discoverireland.ie). 

Galway to Dingle is a very long bus journey, you'd need to get up quite early for it. Now you could break it up with a night someplace else along the way, like Limerick city. You'll have at least one change of buses, probably 2. And because it's that long and getting around the Dingle peninsula is hard after Dingle town, I would aim to stay there for at least 2 nights."

Driving in Ireland. Is it as much of a nightmare as I've heard?,"I've been to Europe before, but have always taken public transportation. I'm looking to visit Ireland next year and am in a panic about driving in a foreign country on the wrong side of the car and road. I've also heard the country roads are very narrow and the locals drive like ""banshees out of hell."" Not my words. 

How fearful should I be? Is my fear unfounded or should I be as freaked as I am? Any suggestions to ease my anxiety about this?",How long have you been driving? Do you know how to drive stick? I just came back from there and I had fun. I opted for an automatic transmission so that I'd have one less thing to worry about. Here's my take on driving in Ireland. In american we have bigger lanes on our streets then ireland an a lot of europe does which is really interesting when you have a bus coming towards you the other direction. The highways are nice and big and they have those raised reflectors on them to help you stay in your lane (I've heard them called road turtles before). But I found most of my driving was done on back roads so be ready for a lot of single lane roads with hedges right up against the freaken road. Honestly I had a great time driving roughly the same parts your going to drive. But Dublin was not as fun. It's a lot if one way streets and certain streets were for buses only during certain times and my GPS didnt know this so I could of easily gotten a ticket. Maybe the cops are use to it so it's not a big deal but I dont know that. The part I couldn't believe was some of the posted speed limits on the country roads were freaking insane. It was posted as 80 km/hr but I was only comfortable doing 60 so dont feel pressured in doing the speed limit cause I saw a lot of locals only doing 60 too. It took me two days to relax into driving so have fun and make sure you have a good navigator with you. Someone who wont stress you out and have fun with it. It's beautiful driving I found.
What are the best ways to get around Ireland by public transport?,"In august I’m planning on traveling to a few places in Ireland by public transport. What are the options I have as a tourist and student? Are there international student discounts? 
I’ve heard of a Leap card, but what does top up mean, how do I buy one and how do I use it? What other options are there regarding bus/metro travel within cities and train/bus travel between places?","Not sure if an international student id is valid for student discounts here, you'd have to check the terms and conditions. 

Leap card is the name of the cashless ticket system here, leapcard.ie is their website. But you don't need one, and a tourist one is only really useful short term in an urban setting. 

There's some intercity rail, semi decent bus coverage between cities and alright to patchy local buses around some cities/urban centres. 

Really what I'd say to you is plot where you want to go and then meticulously google the transport options. Without any sort of itinerary we can only give you broad strokes and you need specifics. 

Transport for Ireland is the new public transport umbrella, they have a website and a couple of apps that will be of use, especially as there are many private transport operators around the country who run in lieu of or better than government funded ones"

Don't be worrying about leap cards too much time and hassle. Plan where you want to go and what mode of transport. This website and Google are your greatest assets. The people of Ireland are very hospitable so don't ever be afraid to ask somebody for directions or what direction to take. You will be surprised the lengths we will go for each other so take advantage of that and give back in return. The government transport organisations are practically indistinguishable from one another. Google will provide you with numbers to ring for these organisations so you can always call them and ask for information. Just don't forget to be courteous even if you get a grumpy fecker, it's their job.
If you're only planning on staying around Dublin perhaps a leap card is viable after surveying your options but that's up to you to decide as you need to figure out the specifics. However if you plan on going outside of Dublin and you don't have time to waste, I would suggest getting the train to the neatest town/city of your destination and considering bus options from there. Just be considerate that most buses to rural areas will cease around 5/6 in the evening so plan accordingly.

Irish transport is a bit weird like that. Or if you are taking a long bus from Dublin to Galway the city link doesn’t accept leap cards but it’s only 10€ so not huge deal.

You can add money at the shops. Just say you wanna top it up/put money in it. You need to put atleast 5€ each time. But you can download the app Leap Top-Up to add money from your phone. But maybe that’s only on the Irish App Store in apple. Not sure. But you can also add money at any Train station or LUAS stop alternatively if you don’t wanna do a shop."
Kid-friendly itineraries,"I've been to Ireland a few times (but it's been a while), and I really want to take my husband and kids next April. My kids are young (they'll be 3 and 5). We know with kids we're really traveling at their pace and conscious that we don't want to overwhelm them with too much to do, because they get stressed and have meltdowns, and it's just not fun for anyone.  


I could use some advice for kid-friendly itineraries for 9-10 days in spring. Everything doesn't have to revolve around them, but we want to make sure they don't get super bored. We'd prefer to take public transportation or taxis, but understand we may need to rent a car.   


I was thinking Dublin, Kerry, Galway/Clare (maybe Ailwee cave), and then the north. I personally LOVE Donegal but I'm not sure if it would be too much to include, without much to do. And I'd love them to see the Giant's Causeway and even Belfast.   


Thoughts?","Soooo we just planned ours and are bringing a 4 yr old next May.

What we are doing is landing in Dublin and then headed west. We’re stopping for one night in Roscommon to break up the drive and to let my husband sleep bc he doesn’t do well with overnight flights.  After that we’re going to go to Bunratty for a day because We have been prior and it’s great for kids and they have a fun folk park.  

Then we are staying in Liscannor for 3 nights as a base point so we can do the Cliffs, Doolin, Aran Islands, Burren, etc.

THEN headed to Westport for 3.  We found a house so we can base out and do a day in Achill, Westport Ferry, Westport House

Then 4 nights in Donegal then back to Dublin to fly home.  Below is a clip from my notepad app of ideas we found for our family if it helps.

Kid-friendly itineraries,"I've been to Ireland a few times (but it's been a while), and I really want to take my husband and kids next April. My kids are young (they'll be 3 and 5). We know with kids we're really traveling at their pace and conscious that we don't want to overwhelm them with too much to do, because they get stressed and have meltdowns, and it's just not fun for anyone.  


I could use some advice for kid-friendly itineraries for 9-10 days in spring. Everything doesn't have to revolve around them, but we want to make sure they don't get super bored. We'd prefer to take public transportation or taxis, but understand we may need to rent a car.   


I was thinking Dublin, Kerry, Galway/Clare (maybe Ailwee cave), and then the north. I personally LOVE Donegal but I'm not sure if it would be too much to include, without much to do. And I'd love them to see the Giant's Causeway and even Belfast.   


Thoughts?","I feel this lol.  We live in a smaller town and our regional airport had the best flight option for half the price with just one layover.  We looked at flying to Shannon but we’d have to drive an hour and a half to the nearest bigger city then pay to park at the airport and shuttle and not the airline we prefer. 
Our small regional has free covered parking and security is literally 10 minutes.  The idea of not having to drive and find our car on shuttle buses after 2 weeks of traveling was amazing."

Thoughts?","You could bring the kids to the rugby match, if they don't like it you can always leave again. However if you don't think they will like it and you really want to go, you might have to leave them with a babysitter.

Lots of beaches along the coast there, take your pick. Look for 'blue flag' beaches, they are the ones with lifeguards on duty. Some will also have surfing classes and bodyboarding. The water is very cold so you'll have to  rent wetsuits.

Bunratty Castle and Folk Park between Limerick and Ennis is a nice spot for kids. In addition to the model town and the castle, there are reconstructed cottages from various parts of Ireland and a working farm in the complex. A great place for a family day out.

I'd also suggest LAW, which is the Limerick Animal Welfare sanctuary near Kilfinnane in County Limerick, they love having visitors to 'help out', you get to meet the horses and goats on the farm and even walk a dog if you like, all they ask is a donation. Now, it IS way off the beaten tourist track, but the area it's in has some really cool places for forest walking, mountain biking, and you can also visit some ancient ruins in the area like the Grange Stone circle and Stone Age village beside Lough Gur, and the mediaeval town of Kilmallock is easy to explore and has some really cool buildings that are hundreds of years old. The region is known as Ballyhoura country and there are worse places to stay for 3 or so nights! It's also close enough to Limerick, Cahir, Cashel, the Glen of Aherlow, Doneraile (Doneraile Court and Wildlife park is great) and Limerick city to be a good base for longer day trips.

Another super location is Kells Bay down on the Ring of Kerry Peninsula, it's near Caherciveen and Valentia Island (tetrapod tracks, mining activities, and an old telegraph station, plus a great view of Skellig Michael, weather permitting). Also nearby are ancient stone forts, ruined castles, beaches ..... If you're really lucky you'll see pods of dolphins swimming. Please note that wild dolphins can be quite dangerous. Derrynane Strand and the Caherdaniel area is stunning and great for families, and there are boat trips in the area. Close to Kenmare is Gleninchaquin Park with a stunning waterfall and some lovely walks. You might also be able to get the cable car over the sea to Dursey Island - on the Béara Peninsula, it was out of commission for a few months because it needed replacing so check that out first."
4 day itinerary review for August,"Husband and I are finally going to Ireland after postponing it for 3 years.

two 17 y/o visiting in Dublin.,"Hi guys!

So, I will come to Ireland this autumn to visit a friend (she is currently in a student exchange program in Dublin).

I'll come with my best friend (because we both want to visit her), but we'll be both 17.

So, I want to ask some questions to you guys.

1. We are coming from Italy, are there something we should know before arriving there?
2. Are the public transport in Dublin good? (probably they're 100 better than ours)
3. We'll probably come from Dublin airport. Is there a cheap way to get to the city center?
4. Is there a card-like thing for the transports? Is it convenient? can I use my bank card?
5. Can I rent a 125cc motorcycle (I have the A1 EU licence) even if I'm ""only"" 17 ?  I'd like to rent one because I'd really like doing some riding there.  
I've watched some sites, but I haven't found anything.
6. In my country the drinking age is 16 for things like beer, how about Ireland?

Sorry if my english is not like a native, but I'm working really hard on it.  
Thanks to all the people who will reply.","Buses from airport to city centre are regular. Hostels will require ID, you may want to look into their rules prior to booking. Dublin is very expensive for eating/drinking. If you stick to tourist areas you might be ok with getting served alcohol but be prepared to be refused or asked for ID. Dublin City centre public transport is fairly good, we have a tram system and regular buses however it isn’t a very big city so walking is a good option. Enjoy your stay."

Where are you staying? Have you booked accommodation yet?

>2. Are the public transport in Dublin good? (probably they're 100 better than ours)

It's ok, if you're staying in the city centre you may not need it often

>3. We'll probably come from Dublin airport. Is there a cheap way to get to the city center?

Depends on what time your flight arrives in at but a regular Dublin Bus is no more than 3.30€ change only fare per person from the airport. More direct buses are more.

>4. Is there a card-like thing for the transports? Is it convenient? can I use my bank card?

These are called LeapCard here, you can look up the visitor Leap card options which are fixed price for a few days 

>5. Can I rent a 125cc motorcycle (I have the A1 EU licence) even if I'm ""only"" 17 ?  I'd like to rent one because I'd really like doing some riding there.  

You won't need a vehicle of your own but generally anyone under 25 has trouble renting anything and scooter rental is pretty rare here (weather)

>6. In my country the drinking age is 16 for things like beer, how about Ireland?

It's 18 here for everything at minimum, some pubs and clubs enforce higher age minimums even as well. I'm sure given your friend will be living here she'll either be 18 or know people who are who can procure off license alcohol but pubs and clubs are pretty much out, they card everyone especially on student events"

Keep in mind that Irish public transport is not like British public transport.

Getting into Killarney National Park without a car,Hey everyone! I’m planning on hiking a few trails in Killarney National Park.

Of course not all, but you'll see most parts (the entrance, abbey and castle, torc mountain is a beautiful hike, and near torc waterfall there is another hiking that ends up on the ring itself, also you can do the gap of dunloe, you only need a bus to one of the parkings but you can get it in any tourism centre in Killarney and they are cheap).

If you cycle, you can rent a bike and that will give you some more freedom as well to get to some other trails far from the main killarney entrance"

This has stops at Torc Waterfall, Muckross House, Muckross Abbey and Ross Castle as well as in town. It loops around these spots a number of times over the course of the day. [There are some of the winter months it doesn't operate - I think December/January/February - I'm not 100% on those months so might want to double-check that if you are coming out-of-season]

https://killarneytour.com/killarney-tour/

The National Park starts right beside town. Check out Killarney House on a map - literally 5 minutes walk from the centre of town. There's a large chunk of the national park connected to this. You can walk down to Ross Castle and walk in Ross Island.

Also you can walk out to Muckross fairly easily - Out the Muckross Road and once you cross the Flesk Bridge, there is a road that is used for only jaunting cars/cyclists and walkers that will take you into the National Park after about a mile and a bit. Footpaths before this. This is very walkable. Other options are getting a jaunting car and then hiking or renting bikes if you fancy that.

This website has a lot of good information, especially the section on hikes.

If you are coming to Killarney to see nature, I always recommend the Gap of Dunloe trip. Pretty much always gets good reviews.

Recommended tours or way to get from Galway to Cliffs of Moher?,"Edit: edited to say I found a tour that lets you do 5hrs solo at the cliffs while the rest of the group goes on a cruise to the islands and under the cliffs for less than $50 CAD. It's on get your guide. I wasn't able to find it when searching but after contacting one of the tour companies they sent me the link to it.  



Original post:
Hi all. Sorry if this has been asked a lot but when I search I keep getting from Dublin.

I'll be in Galway June 13-15 although coming and going on the bookends. I would like to go to the cliffs on the 14th and walk. A lot of tours I see only stop there for an hour up to 3. I'm an avid walker and my plan was to walk the whole way ideally. I'm not interested in a tour that's only to stop and take pics then pop back on a bus.  

As I'm not willing to sacrifice my non-existent first born, I will not be renting a car when I'm there.  

Does anyone have any recs for tours from Galway? One that is focused on actually spending time there versus driving quickly past?   

Is booking a taxi feasible? I saw Uber isn't a thing in Ireland so that idea is out.   
Google tells me I can take a bus from Galway to Doolin. I'm from Canada, so public transport outside of 3 major cities is complete trash. Is the bus a reliable mode of transportation here? 

Thanks for any thoughts or opinions","No, we're from the US. But we took Irish public transportation extensively and were quite pleased with it."
Where to stay if I want to stay out of crowds on St Patrick's Day?,"Hi all,
I'll be on Ireland from 14th to 22nd. I'll arrive in Cork and will stay in Killarney on 14th and 15th. I was planning to go to Galway from 16th to 19th and do day trips to Cliffs of Moher, maybe aran Islands and Connemara. But I can't find any hotels/hotels available for those days due to St Patrick's day, plus I don't really like party's, alcohol or noise. My interests are hiking, cycling and nature in general.

I was thinking about staying in Doolin for a night instead, then going to Aran Islands, but I'm not sure if there are ferrys available from Doolin at this time, so maybe go and stay in Letterfrack instead.

What do you think? What other towns around that area could be an option?

Edit: I will be using public transport","No, I'll be using public transport"
Travel Plans," Hello all!

Currently I am in my last year of high school (I live in the USA) and my friends and I are planning to do an out of country trip soon after graduation lasting around 1-1.5 months. We are looking to go to Ireland and maybe visit Scotland or somewhere similar if we can fit it in the budget. With that being said we want to experience a good amount without spending too much as we are still in school after all. I was wondering if I could get some recommendations/tips about cities to visit, things to do, and just general logistics (public transport/renting a car, hotels/airbnb, etc). If you can provide any advice it would be greatly appreciated, and thanks very much!","Honestly, here and Scotland for highschoolers is going to be pretty expensive. And you won't have college discount cards because you won't be enrolled yet. Plus, extremely limited car rental if at all, international usual threshold for that is 25. 

Now, there are work away programs like Wwoof you could look at but that's working the majority of your time away. 

Hostelling will be your cheapest accomodation, and buses your cheapest transport but a bunch of the truly picturesque are tough to get to by just bus. 

Tbh, there's a reason most of our teens and early adults fuck off to Thailand for a summer. Even inter-railing around Europe is a cheaper option"

We are looking to go to Ireland and maybe visit Scotland or somewhere similar if we can fit it in the budget. With that being said we want to experience a good amount without spending too much as we are still in school after all. I was wondering if I could get some recommendations/tips about cities to visit, things to do, and just general logistics (public transport/renting a car, hotels/airbnb, etc). If you can provide any advice it would be greatly appreciated, and thanks very much!","Unless one of your group is 26 or older and has a full driving licence, you can forget about renting a car. No car hire company will touch you.

Itinerary Help,"Hello all! yet again another itinerary help request. I am coming to your beautiful country the 2nd to last week of September. I will be flying in with my husband, who will be there for about 3 days, then flying off to the rest of his adventure involving tiny plastic bricks (lego, if you didn't know) leaving me 7 days by myself in Ireland until he returns to Dublin to pick me up to head to Iceland for a few days (what can I say? When we get out, we get out). We will have a car for those first 3 days, so the world is our oyster, but we also know that Jetlag will kill me the first few days. After he drops me off in Galway, I will be reliant on public transportation, i.e. buses and trains. Here is the rough itinerary, open to suggestions: 

&#x200B;

SAT 9/16 Dublin to Bray 

SUN 9/17 Bray to Glendalough to ???

MON 9/18 ?? to rock of Cashel to Galway (my husband will then drive back to Dublin area to fly out the next day)

TUE 9/19 Cliffs of Moher Tour 

WED 9/20 Galway to Donegal

THUR 9/21Donegal to Derry 

FRI 9/22 Derry to Belfast 

SAT 9/23 Giant Causeway Tour

 SUN 9/24 Belfast to Dublin 

MON 9/25 Dublin 

TUE 9/26 Fly to Iceland

 Thank you so much!!! If you ever need help for an itinerary in the Seattle area, give me a holler!","Agree, unless the husband particularly wants to see the Irish   Sea, then a cosy B&B in Glendalough will be far more relaxing, especially when dealing with jetlag. 

OP, the only other thing I'd say is that the Galway- Donegal - Derry part of the route seems quite rushed, especially if you will be relying on public transport to get around. Have you looked at train and bus times to see what you can realistically fit in? Far better to choose one less spot so you can take some time to see the sights than spending your days on motorways or rushing through the countryside, just to tick off another location"
Getting to Dublin from Trim,"Hi - we're using Trim as our home base for our first couple nights in Ireland. We'd like to head into Dublin on a Saturday. We will have a rental car but for obvious reasons don't want to drive into the city.  What would be a convenient place to park and take public transport?  
Many thanks",Google says that the 111 Bus Eireann is your only option

Itinerary Help,"Hello all!

My partner and I are going to Ireland November 25-December 3 from Illinois, USA. Flying into Dublin.

Was looking to get some help on planning on itinerary for it. We have our flights booked already. We also have a hotel booked for November 30-December 3 at a hotel in Dublin. We have a wedding on December 1, after party on December 2, and flight on December 3 so technically those three days are already set in stone and shouldn’t be part of the itinerary.

We fly into Dublin on November 26th, early morning. Was planning on getting a hotel for the night and staying there for a day while we recover from jetlag and just explore the city. Potentially taking a bus tour so we could take the city in and figure out what else we’d like to do at the end of the trip.

Next, we were planning on either doing a day or two in Galway or Belfast, taking the train. We don’t intend to get a car since we would like to just take it easy, and neither of us knows how to drive in a different country and think it will be a little confusing getting used to driving on the other side of the road, worrying about tolls, etc. So for now we just plan on public transport. November 27-28/29 would probably be spent in either of those cities but we need some help deciding on which one. We like nature, and would love to see the cliffs of moher but we don’t know if that’s doable without a car. We wouldn’t mind booking a day trip so that we can go there, I saw a few online leaving from dublin but don’t know if Galway has that option as well.

Then we intend to take the train back to dublin on the 28/29 and get another hotel for the night in the city center and do some more exploring. 30th is check in for our other hotel thats a little farther away, and I assume we will be doing more touristy things/just relaxing on the 30th in dublin before we meet up with everyone for the wedding on december 1-2. 

I guess my main questions are:

-How long should we stay in Dublin? Entire trip and just take the train around for a day trip to Belfast and Galway, then be home at night in Dublin? Or stay for a night or two in Galway/Belfast, before coming back to Dublin. Technically we only have 3 spare nights before we definitely have to be back in Dublin so not sure what best thing to do is.

-If we should stay a night or two in another city, is Galway or Belfast recommended? Like I said, we like nature but also know that the weather won’t always be ideal so we have to work around that. We also like architecture and strolling around cities so it doesn’t have to all be about nature.

-Any recommendations for must see things in Dublin? And also general recommendations for the country and things we should know/ things we should do or see (or eat) while there.

Thanks in advance!",If you can make time and haven’t already been have a look into going to Kerry. Unfortunately the weather won’t be good at that time of year but it’s only a hour further by train than Galway to Killarney and it opens up a day exploring the Killarney National park by bike or tour bus.
What is some good place to rent a car in Dublin that wouldn't cost a golden brick?,"Hello, 

We're flying out to Dublin in a few weeks and would be staying around a week in Ireland. While we're there we'd like to take a car and drive around the island on our own terms. Hence I'm wondering where would be the optimal place to rent a car in Dublin for 6-7 days which wouldn't cost us a kidney or two? What are regular prices to watch for when renting a car? Any other tips around renting a car?

We are planing to start at Dublin towards Birr Castle, Cork, Kerry, Connemara and if time allows it Ben Bulben and other things on the way, then back to Dublin. 

Is a car necessary at all to do such trip in a week time? Are we going to do fine if we rely on trains/busses instead of renting a car? How would it be price wise compared rented car vs other transport?

Thank you for your time and have a good one :)","If you only have 6-7 days you do not have time to see the whole island. Pdrawba line from Dublin to Galway and stay either north or south of that imaginary line. 

A tip for car rental would have been to rent 9-12 months ago. Rentals are in high demand this year and lots of places sold off their excess cars during Covid lockdown. The prices now are reflecting that. You could try doing your trip via public transportation. Or just bit the bullet and pay the rental prices. Can you drive manual? I have a trip June 19 and I rented an automatic. Now when I check prices they don’t even have automatics available for my time frame in June. I am thankful I reserved a car back in September 2021."
Solo trip to Dublin 1/6-1/9 & 1/14. Possibly Cliffs of Moher?,"So this is a long shot but thought I would try. I booked a flight to Dublin for a few days back in November and from there will go to Barcelona for a few more days before heading back home to the US. This trip is next week 1/5/22 - 1/15/22. I'll be honest, I hate that I'm doing this trip during this time with COVID cases increasing and all the new restrictions, but canceling isn't really an option as I would lose out on a ton of money that I put into this. Planning to be extra cautious and safe, so hopefully all goes well! So unless United Airlines cancels my trip I'm still planning to do this. 

Original plan was to visit a friend from Ireland and meet in Dublin and then see my aunt in Barcelona. My friend in Ireland just informed me he isn't going to be available possibly at all while I'm there. So I'm trying to come up with some other things to do. I have a few things I want to see within Dublin using public transportation, but I'm also really wanting to see the Cliffs of Moher as well, which I know is quite a drive. I don't plan on doing a rental car as it doesn't fit the budget now, so was looking at possibly one of the bus tours? But those all seem to be full day trips with stops that I don't really want to do. I mean anything in Ireland is going to be great to see, I just don't want to do those extra stops, mostly for the sake of time and my limited stay in the country. Does anyone know if there are other tours that are ""half day"" Cliffs only or anyone going that I might tag along with or anyone just want to go? hah Obviously I'd help with fuel. Or any suggestions on finding people to do things like this with? I know this is kind of last minute. 

Or any suggestions on other places with great views that are closer and accessible without a rental car and easy to get to? I know Howth Cliff Walk is close and could be cool to see. 

This is my first solo trip abroad and normally something I would not do alone. But we gotta take a risk at some point in our lives right?! A bit terrified, but also excited.","The above comment is good. There is a cliff walk in Howth that’s fun to do no matter the weather. However, another option would be to get out of Dublin immediately and solely do the Cliffs of Moher and stay/focus on the west coast. Galway to the north and then easy to get back to Dublin via public transport. I loved Dingle to the south and that peninsula drive and if you drive/visit the Ring of Kerry in the winter, you shouldn’t have any other tourists. If I were you and had a tiny bit extra spending money, I’d rent a car so you can go where you want easily. Driving on the highways is easy, be careful driving on the small rural roads and I’d honestly avoid driving in Dublin."

You can do the entire Howth head starting from Sutton and following signs for the Howth cliff walk and end your day in Howth in a cosy pub (noting they close by 8pm these days).     Might even be worth staying the night in Howth. If you’re tied to Dublin and like hill walks you can also take the Dart in the other direction (south) to Dalkey and walk through Dalkey into Kiliney and back. And perhaps even throw yourself into the sea if you’re feeling up for it!

Birdwatching site near Dublin?,"Hello!
I've already received some great birdwatching advice here a couple of years ago, managing to see the wonderful puffins (thanks again).

Now I'm coming back to Ireland the last week of August. I'd like to know if there are any good birdwatching places ""near"" Dublin (let's say, reachable in 2 hours) in this season. I won't rent a car so I'll rely on public transport.

Also, I've read that Shenick Island is reachable on foot when there's low tide. Is that good for birdwatching? In that case, from which beach can I reach it and is there a way to go there by public transportation? 

I will appreciate every bit of advice!","East coast nature reserve , wicklow , not far from dublin ,can get public transport and only a short walk from busstop"

Shenick Island is ideal place for birdwatching but please be aware that people often misjudge the tides, become stranded and have to be rescued so time your journey well.

10 Day trip with public transit,"Hello! My husband and I are finally taking our 2020 postponed trip to Ireland this July. We are starting to nail down our plans and itinerary but aren’t sure what to do about transportation. He isn’t super comfortable driving in Europe and hasn’t heard the best stories from friends who have unfortunately. I barely drive in the US as it is (living and working in cities for nearly a decade does that) so I can’t really argue for it either. 

Anyway. I’m wondering if anyone on here has taken a long trip for this amount of time via public transit? Do you have any tips or helpful resources, like excursions and day tours that are actually worth it? For reference we’re looking to stay mainly in Dublin, Killarney, and Galway and venturing out from those hubs.

I’ve heard plenty of times the only way to see everything is with your own car, but I’m just hoping to get some options. Thank you in advance!","Loads of bus trips from those hubs, or if Dublin public transport north and south will put you out in seaside villages and cliffs in 30 minutes. .. Sounds like it might be stress free way of doing it.  Also consider doing things like a day trips to some of the islands... I found the blasket trip from Dingle amazing,  others find more on Aran islands mind."
Cheapest/Best way to get around the country?,"Hi all! Im in the very pleminiary stages of planning a trip with my girlfriend from Canada next spring... but nothing is set in stone and we're totally open to changing the plans.

We wanted to spend 3 weeks in ireland/northern Ireland and are trying to figure out how to get around. We looked at a map and some places we wanted to go/see and thought it would be cool to do 2-3 days in the following cities in this order (making a little circle... kinda). But again, we're not committed to anything, so im open to any suggestions. 

Dublin->kilkenny->limerick->Galway->(maybe 1 night in smaller town in the county of Donegal)->londonderry Derry -> Belfast

Surely, someone has done something like this before and i would love any suggestions. If anyone thinks its better to spend more time in fewer cities, i would also love to hear your thoughts on why!

I started looking into doing this by rail/bus. I think the first portion of the trip is do-able but a bit more expensive than i personally initially anticipated (but that might just be me). Where it starts to fall apart is from Galway going north to Donegal. im thinking renting a car is my only option for that stretch, but its no so bad because that gives us flexibility to go to places along the coast. I would just prefer to avoid renting a car for the trip unless there are no other options or its WAY cheaper. 

So my questions i guess: 
1.Thoughts on the route? Will i have trouble hoping from city to city? What should i expect to spend on transportation?
2. What is your experience with getting around the country? anything a canadian might not consider (other than i should know how to drive stick)? 
3. Is the train worth it for a few bucks more compared to the busses?

Thanks in advance!","Donegal has no train stations...the whole county. And don't think there's much in the way of buses from Galway up to that area.

It's not massively unusual for anyone to have to come back to Dublin to travel on to other areas of the country because of how things were ripped up in the early part of the last century. 

To get cheap fares you sacrifice time"

Thanks in advance!","I think your route is fine, but I do think you will need to hire a car for it.

There is a train line to everywhere on your route except Donegal. I think the train is about double the price of the bus, but you can sometimes get lucky online with cheap fares. You can take the public buses (bus eireann) around the cities and to the countryside but they tend to stop at every stop so the journey can be very long. Some private companies are express so they are quicker and are still quite reasonable. Go bus and Citylink are examples that go to Galway and other cities, but they only go back and forth between Dublin. It’s about 30e return from Dublin to Galway. 

If you do hire a car, I would just be aware that a lot of roads in the countryside are quite windy and narrow and don’t have streetlights. Especially in Donegal! Always add an hour or two to your driving time for stops for food and for getting used to the road conditions. It rains a lot here and that can slow you down when driving too.

Wether or not the train is worth it depends; If you are using Cirylink or Gobus I don’t think so as the buses are quite comfortable and take the same amount of time. If you are time constrained I would use the train over bus Eireann.

Any time I have done a road trip like this, it has always been in a car. It’s more reliable, flexible and comfortable in my opinion! If you have any more questions let me know :)"

Dublin City centre is not that big, so legs will be fine and the luas but I would stick to driving if you are going to outskirts etc. You will have a much nicer time and it will probably work out cheaper in the long run."

"Please help, first time solo traveling to Ireland","Hello all, first thank you for taking the time to read this. 

So let’s get into it. I will be going to Ireland for a solo trip (my first one in Europe, I’m beyond excited as Ireland is a destination that has been very high on my travel list). I will be arriving in Dublin August 30 and flying out of Dublin September 5 and have already purchased my ticket (I know 6 days, annoying). Originally I was going to rent a car and drive the Southwest portion on my own. Seeing as the automatic (can’t drive manual) car rental prices are wayyy over my budget I decided against it, even though that would be my most ideal option I just can’t see paying $2k for a car rental. 

I decided to stay in Dublin my first day and a half so the 30th and 31st since in fly in, in the morning. Then I’m kind of completely lost. I’m using everything to do research (Reddit, forums, trip advisor, books, maps etc.) but it’s so overwhelming. And as many people instructed not to pack too much in, I’m packing too much in. So decided to do the Paddy Wagon 4-day Southwest tour and stay in hostels from the 1-4 and then come back to Dublin for the night and depart on the 5th back to Poland. 

I would be willing to only stay a day in Dublin and leave the next day if I had to. I can cancel the tour 28 days in adjacent for a full refund. I guess my question is: will be better planning my own itinerary using the public transportation system and seeing all the important cities. If I were to create my own itinerary I have a rough idea of how I’d want it to go. Dublin-Galway (Connemara, Doolin, Cliffs of Moher)-Kerry (stay in Killarney to visit the Dingle Peninsula) and here is where I’m lost. 

If I haven’t lost you yet after this very long post please lend me your advice or opinions. I kindly appreciate it. Cheers!","I just got back from a 5 day solo trip my first time as well and packed a shit load of travel in that short amount of time, here is my itinerary below:

2 days Dublin 1 night hostel 1 night hotel
Guinness Storehouse
Jameson Factory
Trinity College 
Lots of Pubs and great food.  

Took the train to Galway 2 hrs spent 1 day: 
You can walk the whole city including the downtown and the “salt hill” area in 1 day 

4 hour bus ride to Donegal Town 2 days 
Walked the entire downtown day 1 
Slieve League on day 2 

It was an action packed adventure my only wish is to next time spend a little more time in Galway and Donegal as there is so much to explore.

Day 7: Travel to Dublin in the morning. Spend afternoon sightseeing Dublin.

Day 8: Sightseeing Dublin or hiking through Wicklow.

Day 9: Sightseeing Dublin or hiking through Wicklow.

Day 10: Leave Dublin early in the morning to catch flight home.

So what do you think of my overall travelplan? Any feedback? Is it realistic? Does anyone also have suggestions on fun things to do in Galway and if the Cliffs of Moher are worth a visit?

Regarding hiking in Killarney National Park and Wicklow, what are some pretty hiking routes of moderate difficulty? (3-4 hours)

Any suggestions on how to travel conveniently and cheap from place to place?

Thank youu!","The Cliffs are nowhere near Galway though, unless you can get a bus tour to bring you and bring you back that's probably not a goer. 

Have you scoped the route from Galway to  Killarney yet?

Same for Kerry to Kilkenny?

Given solely on public transport look at the hikes up the Dublin Mountains (it's the same mountain range as Wicklow). Most of Wicklow Way hike takes you away from public transport unfortunately"

Thank youu!","Yeah you're right, from Galway to the Cliffs is between 2-3 hours by public transport. That might not be worthwhile.

The route from Galway to Killarney is around 4,5 hours with several buses through Limerick. I think if I leave early in the morning, I can still do something else other than travel on that day. I really wanted to include Killarney National Park so I think it's worth the ride.

I haven't looked at the route from Killarney to Kilkenny yet, but apparantly that is also around 5 hours by public transport. Welp, I suppose I will not sleep in for too long then haha.

"Solo 5 day trip, no car. How do I best experience Ireland?","Dia dhaoibh!

I'm going to Ireland in late august. I'm going solo and I haven't really planned anything. I'd just like to see the nature and get a taste of the culture and history of Ireland.  I often prefer going off the beaten track, meeting locals etc. Transportation seems to be the main issue (as it so often is). I heard about a night train from Dublin to the west coast but google isn't very helpful. 

If anyone could give me some pointers I would be eternally greatful! 

I'm a 22 year old guy from Sweden in case it makes a difference.","All Rail lines radiate out from Dublin like spokes of a wheel but generally stop in towns or cities only. If you're looking for remote/rural via train look at services Galway, Mayo or Sligo. Buses can be good for proper 'off the beaten path' travel.

One of the best counties I could recommend for 'off the beaten path' travel is Donegal. Incredibly beautiful and with lots of nature walks and amazing beaches. Ironically it has the worst transport links of any county in the country, a car would be reccomended but You can fly into Donegal from Dublin on a shuttle service. Dunloe, Dunfanaghy, Buncrana, Malin Head, Kinnagoe bay are all beaitiful towns/villages up there. 

Don't know if you can drive but there is a service called Go Car which allows you to pick up a car from a train station drive around as much as you want and return it when you're finished. Nice way to get off the beaten path. www.gocar.ie

www.irishrail.ie has all the train information/routes/times you'd need

For buses:

www.buseireann.ie
www.citylink.ie

These are the main companies."

West/South Ireland Itinerary Advice,"Hey all. My sister and I are planning a week trip in Ireland and are struggling with a couple of the days. On Wednesday we know we are going to take a day trip from Dublin to Galway which includes the Cliffs of Moher, etc. We are staying the night in Galway on Wednesday, and the next part is the problem. We have to be back in Dublin by Saturday night, and are only using public transportation (car rental is a little too expensive for under 25). What would be our best bet for Thursday and Friday? Killarney was our original plan (arrive about noon thursday, stay the night, see surroundings on Friday), but not sure if anyone has opinions on Limmerick or anything else that might save time on public transportation. Alternatively, would anyone suggest us going back to Dublin and finding somewhere else on the East Coast? Thanks!","I wouldn't bother with another long bus trip if you only have a week. Go to Galway, spend your first day just in and around the city as you'll just be off the bus so you won't want to get back on another one. The next day, do a full day tour to the Cliffs. Some of them stop off at Lahinch or Doolin, which are both lovely, and the Burren. Back to Galway and stay the night again and then do another tour of Connemara and Kylemore Abbey if you feel like a dose of scenery.  You don't need to go all the way to another part of the country for that and spend hours on a bus, Connemara is one of the most beautiful areas of Ireland. Friday evening/Saturday morning then, get the bus back to Dublin.  

Also, *always* use private bus companies. Bus Eireann is terrible. Citylink and GoBus are the cheapest, quickest ways to get between Galway and Dublin."

A few questions about Travel to Ireland in COVID times (not holiday),"Hi there, hope you and your families are all safe during this challenging time.

I am an American who has been ""stuck"" in Japan since Feb, before the travel restrictions were put in place. I would very much like to stay put in the Japanese countryside (no covid cases), avoid international travel and wait this terrible pandemic out. But Japan is not allowing me to stay, and for many reasons, I will not be returning to my home in the US, where I have not lived in more than a year. One of the few safe places that we are allowed to enter right now is Ireland. I get that there must be some friction (very understandable) from the Irish about foreigners entering your country during this time. I'm especially curious to hear from other non-Irish who have entered recently under similar circumstances. I have so many questions...

1. What was your experience entering the country? Any issues with paperwork, immigration, or interactions with locals?
2. What resources have you used to keep yourself and others safe during this time?
3. Recommendations for places to stay in the first two weeks to self-isolate/minimize risk of spread? My criteria: sanitary, no bugs, good wifi, and under 1500 Euro for two weeks. If location is good, I'd be willing to stay longer.
4. Do you anticipate being able to extend past 3 months? If things get worse, I really want to reduce the chances that I have to get on another airplane.
5. Is it easy to purchase a used or affordable road bike? Trying to avoid public transport, so my main mode of transit would be bicycle.
6. Any shortage of masks/hand sanitizer? I'll probably bring a months' worth from Japan, but might pack extra if it's hard to find in Ireland.

My plan is to enter Ireland first week of August. I'm not trying to go on a whirlwind tour of the country, though I do love eating at restaurants, so if it's safe and if I'm welcome, hope I can eat lots of tasty food and help out some local businesses. My hobbies are pretty socially distant in nature (cycling, hiking, eating, netflix). I'm very sorry if these questions have been recycled over and over again in this community. I know changes are happening every week so I would really appreciate anyone who could help me out with your recent experience. Cheers and stay safe out there.","So there’s been some serious anti-American sentiment floating around here recently, both online and IRL due to COVID, mainly due to American tourists arriving and not self-isolating for the 14 day period. So, though I think your question and intentions are reasonable, I wouldn’t be surprised if you ended up getting some rude / unhelpful answers.

You seem to be taking the pandemic seriously, and as such, I’ll gladly answer your questions for you as best I can, though as a local, I’m not sure how much help I can be.

I can’t really advise on question 1, nor do I fully grasp what you mean in question 2 - social distancing and mask wearing are the norm, along with hand sanitizer in every shop, so I don’t know how else you could protect people.

As for question three, finding something in that price range should be very straightforward anywhere outside of Dublin. Even in Dublin I believe you could find a place less expensive than that, though it might be difficult to do so. Are you eager to continue living in the countryside? Or would you rather move to one of our cities/suburbs? Many of our cities are very small, the second largest city in the country has a population of 500,000. 

As for question 4, extending shouldn’t be an issue, I know a lot of people who have done so, and nobody was rejected, but a word to the wise, our immigration department is remarkably inefficient, they take a long time to process anything.

5: It is very easy to purchase a used bike.
Check out donedeal.ie 

6: No shortage of either one here! Honestly I wouldn’t bother bringing the months supply unless they’re very cheap in Japan, they’re easily obtainable here.

Hope it helps!"

Need advice on rental car versus buses for Dublin/Galway trip,"Hello all, my husband and I (in our 30s) are planning a trip to Ireland sometime next year (probably September) and I am working on our budget. Originally we were planning to rent a car, but from what I've read in this sub and online, it seems more complex than what I'm used to here in the US (rental insurance fees and all that). I haven't had a chance to dig really deep into various rental agencies' terms and conditions, but it seems like there are significantly more costs than the base daily rates I've found so far. Which I should have expected of course, but things are looking expensive...

I am still going to research more into renting a car, but I was hoping to get some feedback about our (very preliminary) itinerary, should we decide to skip the car and use buses/tours instead.

We are hoping to spend about 10-12 days in Ireland. We would be flying in and out of Dublin Airport and be mainly based in Galway. For the time we are in Dublin, there are a handful of things we'd like to see in the city and nearby. We are especially interested in seeing Newgrange and Wicklow Mountains/Glendalough. I found a few different tour buses that go to those places. After a few days in the Dublin area, we'd take a CityLink bus to Galway and spend several days there. One day would be a Cliffs of Moher/Burren tour day. 

A couple things I'm wondering: Will we miss out on a lot by not having a car? I've already discovered there isn't an easy way to get to the megalithic sites in Sligo via bus (if someone has a clever suggestion about this, I'm all ears!), and we're interested in seeing some more countryside/national parks, castle ruins, etc. We also don't necessarily like the idea of doing too many official bus tours. I think the three I've listed are doable without feeling too rushed or getting too expensive. But then I wonder if it will all come out close to or more expensive than just renting a car? Of course I'll have to try to pin down an estimate for a car (plus gas) as closely as I can, but I welcome any advice about car vs. buses and tour bus trips, specific tour buses/other transport to avoid, and sites we shouldn't miss that are easy to get to from Galway (via bus, train, or car). I need some help thinking outside the box, please. Thank you in advance!","Do not rent a car for Dublin city. It is a PAIN. The city centre is a snarl of one-way street systems and new tram lines, you are WAY faster using said trams or buses or the rent-a-bikes or just simply walking, and this is even BEFORE we get into the extortion-fest that is parking in the city centre. Seriously DO NOT RENT A CAR FOR DUBLIN CITY. For places like Newgrange and Glendalough and Powerscourt, you can join tours. 

Galway is smaller and a bit easier to manage by car, but make sure that where you are staying has its own parking, again extortionate parking costs on the street. Way easier to get around the city on foot or bike. The added advantage of Galway is that the main railway station is right in the centre by Eyre Square, which makes taking the train from Dublin (Heuston Station) a breeze, and trains can be booked on line in advance (but read the T&Cs to be clear). Again, you can join coach tours for excurions into Clare for the Burren and the Cliffs of Moher or into County Galway for Connemara. But you could also just pick up your car from the airport when you're leaving Dublin, or else rent in Galway city. 

If you are renting, check to see if you are old enough - apparently there IS a lower age limit for car rental in Ireland - and also check if you can transfer your own car insurance policy to cover the rental car, which will significantly reduce the cost to you. You will also save if you're comfortable using a manual transmission car, as automatics are in short supply and high demand. And very important, when picking up the car, walk around it with the agent and make sure they note down all the dents and scratches that are already there, and take footage on your phone if you like too - and of course photos of the car from every angle. Make sure there IS a spare wheel in the back that's in good order, someone I know got caught out by that with a rental. And bring plenty of money as petrol is a bit more expensive than it is over your way. And one last thing regarding the car: go on YouTube and look up videos of how to handle roundabouts. Ireland has lots of roundabouts."

For the time we are in Dublin, there are a handful of things we'd like to see in the city and nearby. We are especially interested in seeing Newgrange and Wicklow Mountains/Glendalough. I found a few different tour buses that go to those places. After a few days in the Dublin area, we'd take a CityLink bus to Galway and spend several days there. One day would be a Cliffs of Moher/Burren tour day. 

A couple things I'm wondering: Will we miss out on a lot by not having a car? I've already discovered there isn't an easy way to get to the megalithic sites in Sligo via bus (if someone has a clever suggestion about this, I'm all ears!), and we're interested in seeing some more countryside/national parks, castle ruins, etc. We also don't necessarily like the idea of doing too many official bus tours. I think the three I've listed are doable without feeling too rushed or getting too expensive. But then I wonder if it will all come out close to or more expensive than just renting a car? Of course I'll have to try to pin down an estimate for a car (plus gas) as closely as I can, but I welcome any advice about car vs. buses and tour bus trips, specific tour buses/other transport to avoid, and sites we shouldn't miss that are easy to get to from Galway (via bus, train, or car). I need some help thinking outside the box, please. Thank you in advance!","You might want to do a combination. We traveled in May for 2 weeks. Flew into Dublin and took the train (it was fun) to Galway. 

Spent 1st day in the city

Spent 2nd day renting a car and driving to Cliff’s of Moher. We made a bunch of stops along the way. I planned a route that took us to a castle, abounded abbey, caves, and The Burren. It was a long day, but so much fun! 

The best part about driving is stopping along the way when something catches your eye. Cute little town? Stop! Random chocolate and cheese shop? Stop! Random ruined church and graveyard? Stop! 

My personal advise is to not drive back after dark. The roads are small with no streetlights so it was a little nerve racking. We also paid more for an automatic and all the insurances. It gave me a nice piece of mind.

We took the train back to Dublin.

Maybe pick 2 or 3 days where you just drive and then do public transportation the rest. It’s really fun driving through the beautiful countryside."

Thank you in advance!","My wife and I spent two weeks in Ireland going cross-country from Dublin to Galway over the course of the time we were there. I'm not sure where your home country is (I'm in the usa), but the Irish public transport system is amazing. We did extensive research on rental cars beforehand and decided to go with public transport for everything. Best decision we made! There is a train that goes from Dublin right through the middle of the country to Galway , which is not only cheap but fun to ride. We would get off the train wherever we wanted and use buses to get around at each stop . We saved literally hundreds of dollars compared to the price of renting a car for 2 weeks. Especially in the major cities like Dublin and Galway, a bus stops at every bus stop literally every 10 to 15 minutes. So you don't even lose a lot of time waiting for public transport pick up. Even for the places we wanted to go that weren't near the train stops, there were Charter style buses that took us to the northern and southern areas of Ireland. We had just as much freedom of transport as we would have with a rental car, without the worry of finding places to park or taking care of the car, or gas, etc... we were able to quickly and easily get anywhere we wanted to go in the country and save a ton of money and stress doing so. Public transportation all the way!"

Don't even think of driving a car in Dublin but personally, I would describe the transport system around the rest of the country as inadequate.
Within Dublin, I am sure you'd be able to get daily tickets or single journey tickets for your individual trips.
Two sites I would suggest you check out are gocar.ie, for short term rentals. I have never used it myself but in principal it sound like it might be of interest to you.
The second is the Transport for Ireland Journey Planner app. As an Irlsih person who uses public transport a lot, I would say it is literally the only thing related to public transport in Ireland which can be relied on. Use it before you start your journey to check out possible trip prices and durations and use it when you are here to get around.
You should check out whether buying a Leap card will be worthwhile for you too.

...and has anyone mentioned that you bring at least a light raincoat with you?

Enjoy your trip!"

The Aran Islands is a cool visit too, as it has the old Irish charm. No cars on the island except for one's owned by locals and the ferry is pedestrians only, you can rent bikes though to go up to Dun Aengus, the ancient settlement fort on the other side of the island to the ""town"". 

Also Go Bus is slightly cheaper for bus tickets and offers pretty much the same service to the same place, but busing it from Dublin to Galway is the best job."

Definitely leaning toward renting for a few days in Galway and then using buses/train/tours for the rest. We are both comfortable with manual and roundabouts (even though no one in California—where we live—seems to understand how they work), but we will definitely look up roundabouts on YouTube.

Ireland car rental for young driver?,"I’m travelling to Ireland for the second time with my mother in April, and am searching for car rentals. My mom is a very nervous driver, doesn’t like big cities, uncomfortable driving a standard transmission, etc. I am a very experienced driver, I drive trucks for a livestock transport company so I drive trucks with 50 foot trailers at least weekly and all of my vehicles have been standard, I’ve drove in Toronto, Dallas and LA before. For these reasons we’re trying to find a rental company that will allow me to be a driver with our rental car. 

  I’m 20 years old, and have held a full Canadian drivers license for 4 years, and I’ve had no at fault accidents in my driving history. Anyone know a rental company who will rent to an experience 20 year old? I’ve seen so many wanting their drivers to be over 25. Thanks for any help anyone can offer!","u/ChaChiCoal Sounds like a fun trip! My experience driving on the left side of the road is that it is exhausting. In the US (and Canada too I assume) most roads are interstates or highways where you drive 20-30 minutes in a fairly direct route. In the UK and Ireland, there's no grid of roads -- it's a crazy spider web of roads that requires lots of navigation. Having a nervous 2nd person in the car just adds to the stress (I speak from experience.) 

  
I'm not trying to deter you from getting a car. Please rent a car! It's the best way to see everything! However, I'd recommend zeroing in on one specific area of the country (maybe 2 hour driving radius?) and taking public transportation (bus, train, etc) to that spot. Jet lag is brutal and so are rainy weather conditions. My experience is that you can get better deals on rental cars in the smaller cities."

10 Day Itinerary - Would Love Feedback/Advice,"Hello! My husband and I are going to Ireland for the first time next May from May 12 - 22 and would love some feedback and advice on our tentative itinerary. Thanks so much! 

**In general,** we enjoy beer quite a bit and plan on mostly dining in pubs. We plan to get around via train with a Eurail pass and we'll use public transportation within the cities. We're hoping to stay mostly within the cities since we don't mind walking a few miles to our destinations, but in Kilkenny or Killarney we'd probably enjoy a place a little further out with a view. We don't have many activities planned at this time or things we must do so we're open to any suggestions you may have for these cities! 

**Day 1 & 2 - Dublin**

* *We will be flying into Dublin EARLY at 5AM. Any recommendations on things we can do before checking into our AirBnB later that afternoon?*
* We plan on going to museums, pubs, Trinity Library, dinner at Brazen Head one night and the Guinness Storehouse. Day 2 I would like to go explore Howth. 

**Day 3 & 4 - Kilkenny**

* Train to Kilkenny from Dublin.
* Smithwicks, a castle or two 
* We were planning on going Dublin>Killarney>Dingle, but from my research it looks like Dingle isn't super easy to get to via public transport. *Would you recommend Dingle over Kilkenny?* 
* On Day 4 we plan on renting a car in the evening then the morning of Day 5 driving to Killarney > 

**Day 5 & 6 - Killarney** 

* Drive to Killarney from Kilkenny. This is the only portion of the trip we plan on having a car because we want to drive the Ring of Kerry on Day 6. 
* Turn in our rental car the night of Day 6

**Day 7 & 8 - Galway**

* Train to Galway from Killarney the morning of Day 7 
* Public transport from Galway to Doolin on Day 8 to head to one of the pubs in town to find a tour guide a friend highly recommend that will walk us to the Cliffs of Moher. 

**Day 9 & 10 - Dublin**

* We'll take the train back to Dublin from Galway and spend one more night in Dublin before flying out. We might try to head out to Powerscourt Gardens on Day 9 if we have the time. 

Thanks for reading!","Was in Ireland in October.  I did not drive.  Loved the rail tours to Galway and Cork.  Keep this in mind about driving, who’s ever actually driving will miss a lot of scenery because they will need t to keep their eyes on the narrow road while adjusting the brain to driving on the opposite side of road, road signs that will look foreign, possibly standard transmission car and high insurance costs.  I saw people drive the wrong way while there.  Hell it took me a week before I adjusted to crossing the street and turning my head the right direction.    Maybe you do not stress easily so you would enjoy the challenges of driving but for me it was worth not having to drive."

Help with an artist sabbatical in Ireland,"The title cuts straight to the point of it but I am hoping for some guidance or insight from locals or maybe even other artists that have done the same thing. Here's a little it of background:

I'm considering taking a solo trip as a sort of artists sabbatical to Ireland this year and was hoping for location input that some of you may have. 

Some details about myself:  
31 years old, female.  
Artist with a focus in silversmithing and jewelry design.  
U.S. based

What I'm looking for:  
Somewhere with easy access to get outside of Dublin city, with transportation options to Wicklow. Would love if there was quick access to the ocean or walking trails. Not so interested in popular tourist spots, safety is important. I enjoy small towns more than big cities, but I'll be traveling by myself and don't necessarily want to rent a car. Bray seems like a really obvious answer, but I'm wondering if there's something I've missed. 

My art is heavily nature and music influenced, I use a lot of antique jewelry and silverware in my work, so it'd be nice to be in a town that has antique shop(s). 

I'd likely rent a home or stay in a bed and breakfast for about 5 days in one spot. 

Anyone have any ideas?

I will likely fly into Dublin because that's the least expensive for me and I could spend a couple days there going to museums and whatnot. I'm not into partying or being out late, and I'm willing to use taxis, rideshares, buses, trains, etc. 

&#x200B;

Thank you!","That's the tricky thing, there's not much public transport that goes into the countryside. There's one bus that goes like 3 times a day from Dublin via Bray to Glendalough. And Wicklow town is kind meh. Wicklow is a very you have to drive county. But tbh, I'd not say to you to stay in Bray either. I'd say maybe Greystones or, even a bit closer to Dublin, Dun Laoghaire"
Late October road trip itinerary,"Hi there! My partner and I are visiting Ireland late October and firming up plans. I've done a bit of research online and from other posts on this sub but would love your thoughts on this rough itinerary. We're less concerned about specific activities in each city/town and more trying to plan out our drives and making sure we're booking the right number of nights at each stop.

**Day 1**: Get into Dublin Friday morning, spend the day in Dublin

**Day 2**: Spend the day in Dublin and/or go to Howth

**Day 3**: Get rental car, drive from Dublin to Galway

**Day 4**: Day in Galway (This will actually be Halloween, which I understand is also a bank holiday so I'm assuming there will be lots going on?)

**Day 5**: Drive from Galway to Doolin, see the Cliffs of Moher (stay in Doolin)

**Day 6**: Drive from Doolin to ***Dingle*** or ***Killarney***

**Day 7**: Do ***Slea Head Drive*** or ***Ring of Kerry***

**Day 8**: Drive back to Dublin

**Day 9**: Fly back to the US in the morning

Couple questions I'd love to get advice about:

1. Still trying to decide between the Dingle Peninsula and Killarney/Ring of Kerry. Wish we could do both but my gut tells me we should pick one and fully enjoy it. Leaning towards Dingle from what I've looked up. Any major differences between the two we should take into consideration?
2. Does it make sense to get a rental car from Dublin and start our road trip there? Or should we take the train to Galway and pick up a rental car there instead?
3. We'll be there for the Halloween weekend... any particular event(s) you'd recommend?

Bit about us — we're 2 guys (gay/LGBT nightlife recos welcome!) in our late 30s/40s coming from New York. Love all food & drink, from a homey pub to a fancy cocktail bar and everything in between. We're very comfortable with walking and public transportation, but also excited to get out of Dublin and drive in the country. Overall we prefer to wander around and discover interesting neighborhoods versus booking museums and tours ahead of time (although we're open to any must-see/interesting/quirky attractions). 

Thank you all in advance and very excited to visit your lovely country soon. :)","If in Killarney, do the [Beara drive](https://www.dreambigtravelfarblog.com/blog/driving-ring-of-beara) rather than the Ring of Kerry.

According to the Annals it's there our ancestors first discovered Ireland. It's also way, way less busy. I discovered it in 2015. It keeps drawing me back. 

I tried some of the Ring of Kerry, but in my honest opinion, it's bullshit. It's a shit road full of buses and tourists who don't know how things work on shit roads."
Solo trip to Dublin for Spring Break,"Hello!

I will be visiting Ireland for the first time during my college spring break, on a solo backpacking trip to Dublin. From Los Angeles (where I currently am) I will first travel to London to visit friends, then to Dublin for 5 days. Been planning this for months now so I'm super stoked!

I've got a couple questions that I'm hoping kind redditors such as yourselves can help resolve!  


* Besides going to pubs, what's the best way to meet locals and experience local culture? I'll be doing a fair bit of solo exploration but I definitely want to find people to do things with! Are tours with volunteer guides still a viable option?
*  I know this is a sensitive topic, but I didn't want to assume the worst of people anywhere, so I'm asking here. As an ethnically Asian person, should I be concerned about explicit racism during my stay given the context of the coronavirus? A number of friends have warned me about the heightened level of racism in London, so I'm simply asking as a precaution since I'll be in Dublin alone.

Thanks so much for your time!",">* Besides going to pubs, what's the best way to meet locals and experience local culture? I'll be doing a fair bit of solo exploration but I definitely want to find people to do things with! Are tours with volunteer guides still a viable option?

A lot of social activity does revolve around pubs, those guided tours I've seen around have Irish on them as well as tourists from further afield.

>*  I know this is a sensitive topic, but I didn't want to assume the worst of people anywhere, so I'm asking here. As an ethnically Asian person, should I be concerned about explicit racism during my stay given the context of the coronavirus? A number of friends have warned me about the heightened level of racism in London, so I'm simply asking as a precaution since I'll be in Dublin alone.

Can't guarantee that you won't run into the odd arsehole put once you stay out of the shitty areas (that you don't really have need to be in anyway) you should avoid most sticky situations. 

>* I won't be renting a car, and I'm a huge fan of public transport! Any tips about getting around the city, either on foot or by bus/rail?  

City itself for the touristy bits (do the touristy bits) is very walkable but we've buses and a tram service that can get you about of you want it to. Also the DART if you fancy a day trip out a bit further. 

If you think you'll use public transport look at a visitor leap card. Means you don't have to always have change on you"
Road trip in Ireland,"Hi Everyone!

So we've finally saved up some money to travel to Ireland for our holiday. It's been a long dream of ours, so we're very glad that it might happen finally (especially that we are both vaccinated, so we will be allowed in hopefully). We have no specific destination, but we have a few ideas. I'd like to collect some suggestions from the fine citizens of this beautiful country.

Our plan is that we arrive by plane in the middle of August, and stay for around 10-12 days. Our ideas:

* Looking around in Dublin --> ideas are most welcome, what is a must see, how long would be ideal, etc. If we rent a car for our stay, should we get it already for Dublin, or is public transport / taxis better for that day/days?
* We want to rent a car, and drive around the country. No specific destination. But most importantly, no highways, only small roads with the beautif scenery. We would stay in a different town every day / every 2nd day. We're open to every suggestion what places you consider the best. We are not looking for 4-5\* hotels.
* We would like to visit actual local places, like pubs, and so on. (We are not the party all day type of people, so no night clubs)
* We would like to go hiking too maybe
* If we buy presents for our family at home, we'd like to ship them home with a packaging service (when I worked abroad for half a year once, I did this a lot. So I'm looking for a reliable postal service)
* We don't want to see everything right now. We'd be very glad to come back some other years too.
* I'm not a tough guy, so we'd like to avoid rough neighbourhoods (if there are any at all)

We are open to every suggestion, and I'd love to hear it from those, who actually live there. Thank you very much in advance!

One last point: I might propose to my girlfriend of 5 years, so if you have a perfect place for it, that'd be also a highly welcome suggestion.",">* Looking around in Dublin --> ideas are most welcome, what is a must see, how long would be ideal, etc. If we rent a car for our stay, should we get it already for Dublin, or is public transport / taxis better for that day/days?

Don't attempt to drive in Dublin, noone needs that stress on holiday

>* We want to rent a car, and drive around the country. No specific destination. But most importantly, no highways, only small roads with the beautif scenery. We would stay in a different town every day / every 2nd day. We're open to every suggestion what places you consider the best. We are not looking for 4-5\* hotels.

Don't be arbitrary and avoid the motorways/dual carriage ways stubbornly, they're there for a reason and not every village has somewhere you can actually stay so be aware of that.

>* We would like to visit actual local places, like pubs, and so on. (We are not the party all day type of people, so no night clubs)

Remember if you're driving, you can't be drinking all the time 

>* We would like to go hiking too maybe

Grab an app like all trails

>* If we buy presents for our family at home, we'd like to ship them home with a packaging service (when I worked abroad for half a year once, I did this a lot. So I'm looking for a reliable postal service)

The easiest way to do it if you're moving around is via An Post, our national postal service but most of them don't sell packaging (bubble wrap, boxes etc) so be aware of that. And it won't be cheap either

>* I'm not a tough guy, so we'd like to avoid rough neighbourhoods (if there are any at all)

Unlikely you'd accidentally wander into one

>One last point: I might propose to my girlfriend of 5 years, so if you have a perfect place for it, that'd be also a highly welcome suggestion.

As I said to someone else the other day on this question on here, don't plan a place because the weather can fuck you over good here so just wait until the vibe is right and just do it then, wherever you are. Just have the ring with you if you're doing that bit."
Visiting a Grave,"A close friend of mine unexpectedly passed away recently and has had his funeral in Ireland followed by a burial.
He and I bonded over politics and he cheered me on to vote and was a very involved visitor — one that America would have been proud to make its citizen someday. (And would have been an even prouder me voting alongside with him)

His birthday will fall shortly after early voting begins here and I wanted to visit his grave and place my “I voted” sticker on his grave (and frankly, have a good long cry)

I have read up on all the Level 3 restrictions so far. 

I live in NYC, have strictly followed all social-distancing protocols and have been tested twice and negative each time.

I intend to continue exercising all precautions and even will take another Covid test right before.

**If I only intend to visit the grave on his birthday and do nothing else, have contact with no one else, but just fly back to NYC after — How do I go about doing this the right way?** 
His grave is in County Clare.

Firstly — is this doable at all?

Secondly — if doable, What is the right way for me to do this? I will fly into Dublin.

I, of course, want to do this compliant with all local laws, and applying for all the right permissions — how should I go about it?

What modes of transportation can I hire from Dublin to his grave and back that will still be compliant under Level 3 restrictions? 

Ideally, I am happy if I am able to visit his grave, if only for an hour and return back and even just climb back on a return flight to NYC. 

I was also looking at flying into Shannon — far closer to his grave and also being the same county. But there are no options for SNN from NYC. I am happy to consider alternate routings if you folks feel flying into SNN is my best chance.

Any help would be greatly appreciated. I am happy to file out my detailed plan with any Irish government department or get in touch with them and want to do this in the most rightful, compliant, and safe way.

And it would be a personal closure with a great friend who was taken way before his time. 💔

Please advise me.
Thanks in advance!","There are Aer Lingus flights from JFK to Shannon, they look to be all sold out in the short term here though.

If you were to come over, you'd have to self-quarantine for two weeks on arrival. You would also not be allowed to use public transportation since it would not strictly be a necessary journey. Though, since you're going to a graveyard in Clare it would be likely that a car rental would be a much much easier option in any case, Clare is pretty rural and public transportation is limited.

I know it's hard, but the best and safest option would be to just wait and visit in the future."

**(QUESTION 7)**","Hi, we just spent 12 days there on public transportation. We only did Dublin and Galway, but I can give you some tips. Book your train tickets online, and you'll get a discount. Write down your reservation number after you book. When you go to the train station, go to a ticket machine, enter the number, and print your tickets. This saves us some good money on tickets. 
Also, buy a LEAP card for the buses, sold at most convenience stores like Spar, Centra, Gala, etc. This gets you 30% off the fare. Download the LEAP top up app so you can check the balance and add more money as needed. 
Download Moovit app, which will give you details on which bus or train to take to wherever you want to go. 
Galway is wonderful! Go to Eyre Square on the bus and walk down the Latin Quarter, check out castles along the way and also the Spanish Arch. Galway is very walkable. You can also pick up souvenirs as you stroll. 
Have a great time! The Irish are fantastic people!😃😊"

Take the direct train from Dublin Heuston to Killarney (Irish Rail) at 8:30 AM and arrive around  11:30 AM. We would like to stay in Killarney until Day 5 to explore the city, and the national park. 

Sleep in Killarney

**(QUESTION 1)**

* ***Day 3- Monday + Day 4- Tuesday - Killarney***

Visit the park. Sleep in Killarney

* ***Day 5- Wednesday - From Killarney to Dingle***

We plan to take the Irish Rail train from Killarney to Tralee at 07:48 AM and arrive around 08:30 AM then there is a bus from Tralee at 9:00 AM (Bus Eireann 275) which arrives in Dingle around 10 AM. If we lose that one there is another at 11:15 AM, so I think we’ll arrive in Dingle at worst around 1 PM. Sleep in Dingle

**(QUESTION 7)**","Thank you for your suggestions!

About the car: the original plan was to rent a car, but prices are really too high this year: 10 days in August with full insurance is around 1700€ -2200€.

The rest of the traveling is not so expensive: we bought the flights for 150€ per person with the luggage. For 10 nights with AirBnB (2 in Dublin, 3 in Killarney , 1 in Dingle, 1 in Tralee, 3 in Doolin) we ~~payed~~ paid in total 990€ (445€ per person) and we estimate around 180€ per person for public transport (we took the fares from official site for bus and trains) and 200€ per person for tours and bike’s rent . So in total we’ll spend around 1000€ per person without food and supplies. To hire a car would easily duply this budget. We hope we could return in Ireland in the future and explore all the country with a car, but unfortunately this year we have to do in this way."
First time visitors in October. Some help perhaps?,"My wife and I will be traveling for the first time to Ireland at the end of October for 10 days. We have decided to split the time between galway and Dublin evenly. 

In galway we have decided on Victoria hotel which is in Eyre Square. Being smaller, we have read that it's best to stay within the city center, especially since we'll be relying on public transport. On our stay, we will want to do day trips to Cliffs of Moher and Connemara. If weather permits, possibly fly to Inishmore. And just soak up the city the rest of the time. And quite possibly get soaked with the rain. But rain and wind doesn't scare either one of us. 

For Dublin we're a little torn of whether to stay in the City Centre or in one of those seaside villages that are accessible through the Dart system. Our plans are some distilleries, museums and just learn about the history of your great country. We love to just hang out and explore the places we travel to without too many plans.  We don't necessarily need to be out partying all night. We much prefer a nice pub to have a drink in vs a crowded club or anything like that. Any recommendations for hotels in Dublin would be greatly appreciated. Up to 150$ per night would be OK. And we don't mind being out of the city center so long as it lays within easy access to your Dart line as we plan to get the visitor pass for our visit. We will  would definitely entertain any city Centre options. Being first time visitors, we think that may be for a better experience. Who knows. We're just a little lost for reservations in Dublin. 

So far, our Dublin hotel choices are The Arlington, Ashling Hotel, Jury's Inn Christchurch, and Sandymount. 

As for seaside towns we've read good things of Royale Marine Hotel in  Dún Laoghaire and the Grand Hotel in Malahide. 


Thank you for your time reading this and your suggestions in advance.

Edit: think I have the luas and dart system confused. Apologies. I'm referring to the rail system for public travel around Dublin.","I'd personally stay city centre and visit the seaside places during the day, there's just more to do in town in the evenings. 

The Royal Marine in DL is expensive enough. The hotel's you listed for Dublin...I generally wouldn't touch with a barge pole tbh. Sandymount is grand but I'd not base a holiday there. If you want somewhere not too central but near stuff (buses will also get you around, you don't need to be wed to the dart) have a look at the Ballsbridge/Baggot St/ Pembroke Road area. You get the small town aspect like Sandymount but it's not as awkward to get in and out of town."
Places to visit in Ireland during Christmas,"Hi everyone,

I am new to Ireland (moved here only 6 weeks ago from non EU country). I just realized I will be having 5 days off during Christmas and I would like to do a little travelling. I am thinking of visiting Cliffs of Moher but what other places can I visit.

Since, I am non Irish/EU I cannot visit any place in Northern Ireland.","You can get a bus to Glendalough - there aren't many every day, but it might be worth checking out. Newgrange is wonderful but hard to get to on public transport. If you want to get out of the city, you can get the Dart out to Bray or Greystones to access the beach - nothing like a walk on a cold, windy beach at Christmas."

Your other problems include, but not limited to; weather, reduced transport schedules, reduced daylight and cost & availability of accomodation if you choose the stay over option. 

2 ways I see it, either (and I'm assuming you're in Dublin or another large urban town or city) stay home and do some touristy things near by which is very low cost, means you're not unnecessarily taking public transport long distance in a pandemic and you get to know your new home better.

2nd way, you hit up the hotel booking sites and see who has availability and is it crazy money. Given the lack of car etc I'd say go to another town/city. 

Leave the Cliffs until you're more likely to see them and not get blown off them"

Unmarked cars sitting on the motorway outside Newry and pull over the buses to check visas and passports. And to be very frank, if they stop the bus and you don’t look or sound local or from Great Britain then they’ll definitely ask. 
They aren’t always there or checking, but it’s silly to say there are no border checks."
7 Day packed tour of Ireland,"Hello Everyone.

We've been planning a jam packed 7 day trip to Ireland in May for a little while and I wanted to get an honest opinion if we are speeding through too fast to really enjoy ourselves.

Any suggestions are welcome! Thank you! 

Edit: Thank you all for your opinions! We are going to revamp based on your comments and go no further north than Galway.","Day 1: You're taking the worst route to Cork from Dublin. If you take the M8 and DON'T go to Kilkenny, you'll have other options: You could stop at the Rock of Dunamaise near Portarlington, for example, and then go on towards Cork and stop at Cashel for the Rock there, and soon after you could stop at Cahir for Cahir Castle. You could even do a slight detour near Mitchelstown to Doneraile Court and Wildlife Park if you wished. 

Day 2 is ridiculous. Stop. Just go as far as Kenmare, and stop at Ross Castle and Muckross along the way. You could do the walk to the Meeting of the Waters, and then go on to Kenmare, going further is just exhausting and silly. You clearly have no idea what the roads are like in that area. 

Either scratch day 3 and the visit to Dingle - seriously, you have NO idea what the roads are like in that area - and just go around the Ring of Kerry and the Staigue fort, etc. and stop for a night before continuing on to your next night, or backtrack to Killarney and go on to Liemrick from there. Or you could drive from Kenmare to Killorglin via the Ballaghbeama Pass. Google it. But don't attempt it if driving tiny narrow roads with a steep drop on one side scares you. 

The more I read this, the more I am sure you are not aware that roads in Ireland are NOT BUILT for the kind of high-speed travel you are used to. Throw this thing out the window and start again. Pick a CORNER of Ireland, and base yourself there."

I rented a car last time and I am renting again this time. I have heard that public transport in Ireland (at least trains) is really centered around Dublin. So often you will have to go back to Dublin to get a train elsewhere. This will add time to your plans. Without a car you should be thinkingi ts going to take the majority of a day to travel from one place to the next. I have heard its a 5 hour drive from Dublin to Dingle without stopping. And if you are taking public transport that is probably going to involve a few train/bus changes. So just add that transportation time to your daily plans. Also even driving gets tiring. Are you from the USA? I enjoy driving, but in Ireland even a 1-2 hour drive was exhausting and i felt like it tired me out. I think you would be wise to look into flying to Kerry if you want to start in Dublin."

You can get a bus from Dunmore into the city (check bus times), and spend a good day wandering around the city. There is a small area called the Viking Triangle with several museums - the Museum of Time, Medieval Museum, Eighteenth Century Museum, Museum of Silver - and a beautiful eighteenth century Anglican cathedral. And an interactive King of the Vikings experience, and Reginald's Tower, a late Viking stone tower. And Waterford Crystal is literally across the road. Between all that and finding some nice restaurants, cafes and pubs to refresh yourself, you'd easily fill the whole day. 

You COULD take a bus to the coast, to Tramore, for example, but it might be a bit tight.

Giants causeway from Belfast public transport information,"Giants causeway using bus and train from Belfast Info
from Northern Ireland so wanted to post this for tourists visiting Giants Causeway from Belfast

from Belfast go to Great victoria street train station the entrance is to the left of the europa hotel the entrance says ""Great Northern Mall"" walk down this turn left walk through the bus station then turn right (the bus station is called europa bus centre btw)

at the train station ticket office buy a Zone 4 i -link card this costs £16.50 (remember we use pounds in Northern Ireland not euro)

2. board the Derry-Londonderry train to Coleraine Or Catch a Portrush train (both stop in Coleraine so do not worry about that)

3 ride the train for a 1hr 25 min up to Coleraine and get off in Coleraine which has a under one roof train and bus station

4.Catch the Causeway Coast Rambler bus to Ballycastle the service number is the 402 service this takes you via Portrush and Bushmills etc and drops you off within minutes of the giant causeway visitor centre ignore going into the centre its pure crap and a rip off just go down to the causeway via the tunnel to the right of the visitor centre, your I-link card covers you for unlimited bus and rail journeys anywhere in Northern Ireland so dont worry about that use www.translink.co.uk to plan your journeys to and from Belfast the trick is select the Journey planner tick bus and rail journeys and then put in the to and from fields

""Great Victoria Street rail station"" to The aird the nook Giants causeway"" (the Nook is a pub and restaurant yards from the visitor centre btw )

safe travels !","If the weather is nice and you like a good 3-4 hour hike, you may prefer to get off the 402 bus at Dunseverick Castle and walk back along the cliff top path to the Giants Causeway.

question about transport,"Hi! Me and my 2 friends from countries in the eu are coming to Ireland this September. We are kind of broke and want to do camping in the south West Coast.

What apps, websites or companies would you recommend? Thanks!","Trains link many major towns and cities, but the network is not extensive. Buses will give more coverage.

Getting around Ireland,"I am an American planning on visiting Ireland for 3 days in late December. We are landing in Dublin and want to book a cabin in County Cork.

Was wondering if a train would be the best option, a bus, Uber or whatever. Let me know thank you! I am so excited to visit","Only three days? You'll spend a day travelling from Dublin airport and another day travelling back. Whether you drive or take public transport.   You are probably better off thinking about somewhere nearer Dublin.

Personally, I like taking rail from Dublin to Galway and places in between. You can take busses in the city, but truthfully, renting a Coca-Cola bike or rental
Scooter is usually faster within the city if you have a ways to go. Check the bike times versus the bus times in Google maps.

Leap cards aren’t necessary, but they are the most convenient. You can use cash, I believe. However you need to have exact change which is a royal pain. That why the Leap is a better option.

Note that separately, there are requirements for a student leap card to get discounts on the bus. For the train, you don’t need a leap Card to get the student discount, just your student ID.

I’d take the train for city to city over the bus. It’s more scenic, and less cramped."

A couple days in Ireland without a car,"I'm spending a couple weeks in Europe, and am ending with a flight back home from Dublin. I'm not comfortable driving/renting a car so would like to use public transport. It's been difficult to figure out a realistic plan to travel from the west to east side of the country without a car (I don't want to go from Dublin to Doolin and back to Dublin, for example).

Can someone tell me if this sounds reasonable?

* Day 1: fly from Scotland into Shannon airport
* Spend night in Doolin
* Day 2: Visit Cliffs of Moher, Doolin Cave etc
* Take public transport to Dublin
* Spend remaining 3 nights in Dublin before flying home

Instead of all that time in Dublin, should I try to stop halfway in Killarney or Galway? Will I feel like I'm cramming too much in?

I'd like to note that I am okay with lots of fast-paced travel and walking everywhere plausible. I want to see all that I can even if I'm exhausted.

Thanks!","Dublin, at least in my opinion, doesn’t warrant more than 1 night (or maybe 1 night and a return on your flight out). There’s plenty of “Touristy” stuff to see, but unless you’re really into Art, Theater or Museums it can be done in a few hours or a full day. I’d pick like 4 things from the list  below:

Note to others: DONT DRIVE IN DUBLIN. It’s a waste of time/money/frustration. Parking is expensive, traffic is terrible. Just either take the bus around Dublin, buy a “hop on” tour pass, or rent one of the MANY e-bikes. I use “Bleeper” as I don’t think they require a deposit.

- Trinity College and the Long Room/Book of Kells
- Gravediggers or the Blue Light & Johnny Foxes
- Guinness Brewery
- Dead Zoo
- National Gallery
- Chester Beaty 
- SKIP JAMESON, opt for Teeling instead
- Wax Museum (?)
- There are a few hikes around Dublin, but you need a car to get there.
- Stephen’s Green
- The Dublin Zoo


I’d stop in Galway for a night instead. Doolan literally has 4 bars and couple of fancy restaurants and a camp ground. Unless you have a place booked for Glamping, it’s not worth staying. (If you’re booked at Soolan Glamping, it’s awesome for a night).


Edit 2: Galway traffic sucks as well during rush-hours. Don’t drive around the time people either go to or get off work. Galway is walkable/bikeable.


Dublin is expensive. Food, drink.. hotels… you can get a better value staying in another town.

If you can figure out a way to go to Wicklow via Rome to Rio or something- it is beautiful, though. But that’s a day trip.


Doolan:

You can take a ferry from Doolan to the Aran islands OR you can take a ferry from Galway to the Aran islands. 

Doolan Cave is pretty cool, but “smaller” than other caves if you’ve been to any in America. Check out the Falconry though.


Galway:

Galway is one of the cultural centers of Ireland. Plenty of bars, a distillery, and a couple breweries. A good Museum and plenty of random festivals. Good for people watching or just running around town. Everyone who comes to Galway likes it. You can take a bus or rent a “Go Car” for a day rate if you want to drive to Doolan or the Cliffs. Be sure to jump off Blackrock in Salthil.


If you do opt to drive to the Cliffs- skip the lame Cliffs Visiter center and walk along the south west side of the cliffs (left of the visitor center). You can park at a little house on down towards the abandon ruin- just google “Cliffs of Moher private car park”.


Source: I’m an American who works in Dublin, lives in Galway and have hosted dozen or so friends on different trips from America.



Galway also has a lot of Michelin guide or even a few Michelin starred restaurants. Good food there!


Edit 3: saw you’re coming from Shannon instead of the other way from Dublin to Galway. Doolan may make a little more sense as you said for your first night. BUT I’d still stay a night after in Galway."

* Spend night in Doolin
* Day 2: Visit Cliffs of Moher, Doolin Cave etc
* Take public transport to Dublin
* Spend remaining 3 nights in Dublin before flying home

Instead of all that time in Dublin, should I try to stop halfway in Killarney or Galway? Will I feel like I'm cramming too much in?

I'd like to note that I am okay with lots of fast-paced travel and walking everywhere plausible. I want to see all that I can even if I'm exhausted.

Thanks!","Three nights in Dublin is too much. Dublin is the most expensive place in Ireland, and unless you're looking to visit a lot of museums, I just don't understand spending the majority of the time in Dublin. Spend more time in the Galway area. Take a day trip out to Inisheer from Doolin. See if you can book a Connemara bus tour from Galway for a day.

A train from Galway to Dublin is usually around 2 hours of travel time (depending on which time you take it - some have more stops than others), so getting from Galway to Dublin by public transport is really not a problem. If you have an evening flight leaving Dublin, you could easily take a morning train from Galway to Dublin and get to the airport in enough time and not have to pay the extra cost of staying in Dublin for the night."
My wife and I will be visiting Ireland for 10 days next spring for our anniversary. What are some things we just can't miss?,"We are wanting to explore some castles; visit the clifs of Moher, Giants Causway; explore a few small towns, and basically just experience all we can! We fly in April 13th and fly out the 23rd. Nothing we can't do really except drink.  Wife isn't interested at all. We were going to use public transport, but may change that. In and out of Dublin.","I suggest renting a car if you’re here for a while, not only because public transport isn’t great but because of the freedom it’ll afford you. Two absolutely stunning drives you should do are in the west of the country; the gap of dunloe in county Kerry (i did it myself a week or so ago for the first time since I was a child and it’s actually really spectacular). The second is the drive in county Mayo from Luisburgh to Lenaun. Equally stunning but quite different. If you’re staying east in Dublin then you should also drive through the Sally Gap in the Wicklow mountains. No need to rent a car for that. There are plenty of bus tours."

Wander the streets. Pop into a shop, tavern or cafe. Listen to the music. Take that boat ride. Stay out late. Tour the distillery or brewery. Talk to the people, they are so nice. Go into that castle or museum. Imagine what it was like in the 50’s. The 1650’s! Hike the trails. Stop at the WAW turnouts. Soak in all the ambience of that one area. 

There is so much rich culture and history and beauty. It is difficult to let the opportunity to see it slide by because you’re rushing to the “next place”.

Edit: then start making return trip plans for areas you didn’t go to this time."

Public transport will not be running on a normal schedule Good Friday and Easter Monday and will not run at all on Easter Sunday. Big supermarkets will not be open on Easter Sunday but some smaller convenience stores will, same with petrol stations. 
The good news is that around Easter is the start of NI’s tourist season and there are generally always Easter events scheduled in National Trust properties over that weekend. So even if you don’t want to do the Easter egg hunt kinda things, you get a great view of the Big Houses (like old stately homes)."
Day trip from Limerick recommendations (Public Transport or Tour Bus?),"My wife and I are planning a trip to Ireland in August (Not the greatest timing I see now) and we will spend two days in Limerick.

Any suggestions on what to do? Unfortunately, we were not able to secure a rental car. My wife is not the greatest hiking fan, but not unfit. I'm alright with walking a lot.

**What I have come up with:**

* Day 1 - Explore the city + Bunratty Castle
* Day 2 - Tour bus (Paddywagon Tours) along the Ring of Kerry route

Now, reviews for Paddywagon Tours are kind of negative so I was wondering if there was maybe a better way to go about it. Would public train/bus be an option? E.g. a good route to just hop on and off. I wouldn't mind if its not the Ring of Kerry, but somewhere else interesting/beautiful.","Ring of Kerry is a bit far away for a day trip from Limerick. 

You could easily take a bus from the city out to the town of Adare and have a walk around there, it's very pretty, and there are lots of cafés. 

Another easy bus trip from Limerick city is the town of Ennis, also very pretty. 

Galway city is also a doable day trip from Limerick city. I think you might also be able to go to the Cliffs of Moher easily enough as well. I know there's a PaddyWagon Tours office in the shopping centre right there in the city centre, they'll have lots of suggestions for you too. 

You can access the buses via [www.transportforIreland.ie](https://www.transportforIreland.ie), it's easy to buy your tickets online in advance."
Best towns/route for my visit please.,I am planning a visit. I will be flying into Dublin. I will not be driving (I have a hard enough time in my own country😂.) I intend to spend a few days in bray and Dublin. I would like to travel around a bit. I am planing at least two weeks. I need places that I can take public transport to. I would also like to visit a sheep farm. Thanks.,"A day trip or overnight is enough for Bray, it's a small seaside town with not much for tourism outside the seafront and Kilruddery House up beyond Bray Head. It's basically a commuting town for Dublin. 

Public transport isn't necessarily great between every point here, and can limit you to the bigger urban centres for tourism things to do unless you pay to go on private run tours (with the likes of Paddy Wagon Tours). 

And best route depends on what you like to do, what you want to see, how you want to travel. Intercity buses here lock off their loos, there's no toilet facilities on them, so if that's an issue for you on a 3 or 4 hr ride, than that's something to consider and shrinks your pool of places to get to because you'll need trains...and so on"
Visiting Ireland in December! Any tips?,"Hello- I’m an American currently planning a solo trip to Ireland this December. My company gives us generous time off at the end of the year, so it’s a great time for me to travel without using any vacation days.

My initial plan is to start in Dublin for ~2 days, then head to Cork for ~2 days, then to Galway for ~2 days, then back to Dublin for ~2 days (with a day trip to Belfast). My first few days in Dublin will likely overlap with Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, and it seems like many attractions will be closed… any suggestions for what I should see/do instead? My second stint in Dublin will of course cover the Guinness Storehouse :)

In Cork I’m planning to take trips to Blarney Castle and possibly Cobh, but don’t have much planned other than that. For Galway I am planning on taking an 8-10 hour tour that takes me to the Cliffs of Moher, Burren, Poulnabrone, etc. In Belfast I plan on going on a tour that takes me to the Giant’s Causeway and other Game of Thrones locations since I’m a huge fan!

I’m hoping to stay at Hostels to cut the price down, and to take trains/buses between cities. Does this itinerary seem feasible for an 8 day trip? I would also love tips on what/where to eat, what I can expect from the weather in December, and anything else you can think of! TIA!","Christmas Day there is nothing open and no public transport bar a scant smattering of restaurants that you have to book ahead of time (in like, late October/November) and you might get some taxis doing runs...and that's it. 

Stephens Day will be very curtailed public transport and tourism spots may not open at all depending what day of the week it falls on (I haven't looked)

Christmas Eve stuff like restaurants and bars tend to close early.

New Year's Eve is normally a going out shitshow because of trying to get home and New Year's Day you'll have severely curtailed public transport but not everything closes (again, depending on the day of the week). 

Weather...could be sunny, could be pissing it down, could snow, it'll probably be cold"

Transport will be severely limited on those days too, and I can't imagine many tourist attractions like Blarney Castle etc. will be open between Christmas and New Year. 

Even if things are open, if you are planning to travel between cities by public transport, it will eat into your time. If you are in Cork, you can get a train to Cobh, but I'm not sure the Titanic Museum will be open. I'd seriously recommend checking out those venues before making too many plans. Ditto with those tours.

I think four venues is too ambitious. Three would be doable"
Bus 555 from Dublin to Cliffs of Moher. Has anyone here done this?,"Hi everyone, 

Cliffs of Moher is one of my must does on my first trip to Ireland. Dublin is my hub and I’m not very comfortable driving myself there.

So, it seems my options are a guided tour or this bus. Has anyone done the trip by bus? 

Apple Maps says the 555 should do it in about 3.5 hours. 

What do you think?",I would go with a tour company rather than public transport. They will make the journey comfortable and fun. Taking everyday public transport in Ireland is decidedly not fun l. It's unreliable and can often run late.

You can take a round trip ferry for 24 euro, but the pro move is to fly there - Aer Arann round trip airfare is 46 euro. Best part is you beat the ferry (98% of tourists take the ferry) by about 2 hours, so you'll essentially have the island to yourself for that time. Rent bikes, bike to Dun Aengus first, it's the most popular site on the island. See the Wormhole (look it up). 

Beautiful island and even more beautiful when you beat the tourists and have the views to yourself."

Planning a trip for 2 in July 2022 -- Want to see natural beauty!,Hi!  I'm planning a trip to Ireland for myself and my husband in the summer of 2022!   We are nature people and want to see the natural beauty of the country.   Neither one of us are big drinkers and not particularly interested in the bar scene (pubs are fine as we obviously will have to eat).  We don't know if doing a small group tour is the best way to go or maybe finding a place to plant ourselves for several days and then taking short day trips from there.  Any suggestions would be great!   I have read that flying into Shannon vs. Dublin is the way to go for what we want.,"Hi! I'm Irish so in my opinion, it would really be best to drive, public transport is not great in rural Ireland! I'm sure group tours are ok but you'll mostly see the big tourist attractions with the nature/countryside part just being incidental. 
There's so many beautiful natural places to visit (not to mention the lovely scenery as you drive from place to place!) that I don't think you would ever see unless you drive yourself, so I really think if you're going to holiday in Ireland for scenery, then driving is imperative!
As for destinations... well really the entire coast needs visiting! But in particular, I love the northwest coast: Donegal, Mayo, Sligo for rugged seaside beauty, and you absolutely have to visit Inis Mor (the Aran Islands largest island) which you can get to from Galway. 
Then down south, Kerry and West Cork are beautiful but more quaint and slightly less rugged. 
Inland, Tipperary has beautifully green, rich land and you have The Rock of Cashel which is stunning and then Wicklow is really picturesque and natural too.
I holidayed in Ireland many times and still haven't seen everything, and still feel blown away by the beauty so make the most of your holiday by planning a great route and seeing all you can! You won't be sorry!"

Any suggestions would be great!   I have read that flying into Shannon vs. Dublin is the way to go for what we want.,"This is a huge topic, so I'll try to give as many considerations as I can. Hopefully, you will find something of use.

First, for the kind of things you are looking for (wild nature, off the beaten path adventures, rarely visited archaeological sites) I would highly recommend both Beara, Kerry and Dingle Peninsula, and, to a lesser extend Sheep's Head peninsula. All in South-West Ireland, in counties Kerry and Cork. I especially would recommend Beara peninsula and Kerry peninsula (a.k.a the Iveragh Peninsula). The combination of really isolated nature, small towns which are perfect for striking out for multiple one-day trips, good staying facilities and the feeling that you are truly at the edge of Europe, is unparalleled to the rest of the country. I'm biased because I live here, but I do live here for all of the above reasons.

What you are trying to do, can be done with some small tour operators, but honestly, I would recommend hiring a car, doing your own research and striking out on your own. Yes, this will take some planning, but when you finally do a hiking trail you have read about online, or find a stone circle you've only seen pictures of, and you are the only one around and have the whole place to yourself... it is an experience you will never forget.

Flying in on Shannon, Cork or Dublin doesn't really matter. You can get to bigger towns with busses and trains easy enough. But from there, getting to smaller towns, especially outside of tourist season with public transport is difficult. I cannot stress this enough. Although there are some connections, if you come from a place where every little place has a public transport connection, that is not what is going on in Ireland. Especially in the wintertime, smaller towns have such restricted connections, that I would not build a schedule around it. Fantastic if a bus goes, but don't count on it to make an important connection. For the places that you want to go to, yes, Shannon would be better than Dublin. Although Wicklow is beautiful (in that case, fly on Dublin), the really wild and abandoned nature can be found out West.

Once you are here, I highly, highly recommend that you get a rental car. It is by far the best way to see those off the beaten path places. If that is not possible, consider the following options. Know which sites or places you want to visit and hire a cab locally to drop you off and pick you back up again once you have had your expedition. Nearly all towns have local taxi services that you can find online. This can get expensive, but if you are wanting to have these kinds of adventures, and hiring a car is not an option, then this would be an alternative.

Lastly, consider hiring bikes. This is not an ideal solution but can work in a pinch. Most small towns have a bycicle rental place (look up if your destination has them) where you can hire bikes for multiple days. This will give you more freedom to move about or explore sites within reach. Do make sure that you hire helmets and reflective vests though. On the country back roads, there are no biking lanes, and locals are not too accustomed to seeing cyclists on the roads. This is getting better though.

Finally, places to stay to strike out from. For Kerry peninsula: Killarney, Kenmare, Waterville, Cahersiveen. For Beara peninsula: Kenmare, Glengarriff, Castletown-Bere.

If you do decide and go to Beara, one forgotten place that you often have completely to yourself (especially outside of tourist season) are the Cashelkeelty Stone Circles. If you are interested, I did a video about them, here:

From Croatia!,"Hi guys!
My girlfriend and I were hoping to visit the Emerald island in late April or early May for 7 days. Since we are from Croatia there are numerous flights to Dublin but our main concern are the prices of apartments in Dublin. Since we are students we are traveling on a limited budget and are wondering if there are any villages or small towns near Dublin that would have cheaper prices for apartments? We were also hoping to get that Irish nature expirience.
Which brings me to my next question. Is it worth renting a car?
Since we are hikers we were hoping to explore the nature around Dublin and also go as far as Belfast.
Since UK called quits on the whole EU deal how is the situation on the border? Is it easy for tourists to cross it? Is it better to rent a car for what we are planing or to go by bus/train?
And last but not least...hows the situatuon with the virus?
Do we need anything more than 2 vaccines?

Much appreciate.","If you're not coming for the city life specifically, look at Wicklow but it's the start of tourism season so the prices are the prices. 

Yeah you can do Belfast from Dublin via public transport, cheap enough too.

There is no hard border on the island of Ireland, you'd have to double check with the NI authorities website on visa stuff but you should be fine tbh.

Covid restrictions are all basically gone now. What the airlines might require are on them individually. Even on public transport here the wearing of face masks is advisory."
To rent a car - or not!,"We're a family of four (2 adults, two pre-teens) and travel through Ireland for three weeks.  Roughly five days in each stop (Dublin, Killarney, Cork and Galway).  We're active types and will be happy to explore the metro and more rural areas.

I'm stunned at the price and lack of availability of car rentals across IRE.  I'd be looking at \~1,400 EURO for car rental for the ten days and that's without accounting for petrol.  Seems frightful!

Question for the group - what do you think of NOT renting a car and instead:

* Enjoy Dublin and use rent/hour or day car rentals when desired (for a day or two outside the city limits)
* Train Dublin - Killarney and then hire a car (taxi) or rent/hour or day for day trips (as needed)
* Bus from Killarney to Cork, and then hire a car (taxi) or rent/hour or day for day trips (as needed)
* Bus Cork to Galway and then and then hire a car (taxi) or rent/hour or day for day trips (as needed) 
* Train back to Dublin

Does that seem like a good option?  I know nothing about the ability to use trains/bus so this is a bit of a leap for the four of us! 


I suspect that the two trains would be less than 200 EURO for us all - so there's quite a bit of financial room in between for all the private hires/taxis/cars and it would still come in a lot cheaper.  Agree?",IMO You're going to spend too much of your vacation time on logistics with the state of public transport. 3 weeks for 1400 is a good deal.

In Dublin, you can buy a visitor LEAP card that allows unlimited rides, for a certain number of days. We used way more than what we paid; because it covers rides on the city buses, as well as the DART train, which takes you out to the villages. We took St Kevin's bus out to Wicklow National Park. We took Gobus to Galway, a lovely ride. We took a train to Athenry, an amazing medieval village.  The advantage of public transportation is you really interact with locals and experience local culture.  There are regional buses and day tours that go practically everywhere. In total we paid a total of $245 for transportation versus $1500 plus gas at $8 per gallon, and we saw a ton. This also gave us more money to eat the local food, pay admission prices here and there, and take a couple of great day tours. We downloaded Moovit app and it gives you details on what bus or train to take. So, just make a budget and you will have a great time, with or without a car."
To rent a car - or not!,"We're a family of four (2 adults, two pre-teens) and travel through Ireland for three weeks.  Roughly five days in each stop (Dublin, Killarney, Cork and Galway).  We're active types and will be happy to explore the metro and more rural areas.

I'm stunned at the price and lack of availability of car rentals across IRE.  I'd be looking at \~1,400 EURO for car rental for the ten days and that's without accounting for petrol.  Seems frightful!

Question for the group - what do you think of NOT renting a car and instead:

* Enjoy Dublin and use rent/hour or day car rentals when desired (for a day or two outside the city limits)
* Train Dublin - Killarney and then hire a car (taxi) or rent/hour or day for day trips (as needed)
* Bus from Killarney to Cork, and then hire a car (taxi) or rent/hour or day for day trips (as needed)
* Bus Cork to Galway and then and then hire a car (taxi) or rent/hour or day for day trips (as needed) 
* Train back to Dublin

Does that seem like a good option?  I know nothing about the ability to use trains/bus so this is a bit of a leap for the four of us! 


I suspect that the two trains would be less than 200 EURO for us all - so there's quite a bit of financial room in between for all the private hires/taxis/cars and it would still come in a lot cheaper.  Agree?","You haven't factored in the cost of petrol yet. I think taking public transport, booking group bus tours etc. will be fine - you just need to plan things a little more than you would if you hired a car (book things in advance, etc.)"

Gobus was awesome, with toilets and wifi on board, and they load your luggage underneath so you don't have to haul it around. The train was also very scenic and comfortable. We absolutely loved Irish public transport!  Save us much as you can so you have plenty for the next vacation!"
Christmas alone in Dublin,"Because of... life, I need to go on a vacation somewhere and my company shuts off during Christmas time (23rd of December -> 1st of January). I wanted to take advantage of that closing window to visit Ireland for the first time as a solo traveler from the 23rd to the 30th.

I found some Airbnb and the flights for Dublin, but I'm a little afraid about Christmas day itself. I was willing to rent a car for the 24/25/26 to go visit and hiking around Dublin, but I've found 2 main issues: 

1. I'm under 25 (23) and it is pretty expensive;
2. Because of Christmas, the only place I could rent and give it back would be the airport;

Is this a bad time to visit? I already have a list of stuff to do and a couple of tour I'd like to book on the days after Christmas (27, 28 and so on),  but from what I read online, a lot of stuff will be closed.","99.9% of things are closed on Christmas day. Pubs, by law, everything else because public transport shuts down for the day. You'll either have to cook for yourself or try book into one of the very few restaurants that open."

Many outdoor sites close for the winter anyway. 

Here's my suggestion: stay in one of the cities, maybe NOT Dublin as it's so expensive, but Galway or Kilkenny or Cork, and arrange to eat in a hotel on Christmas Day - you would have to book ahead NOW as many places will be booked up. Plan to have your dinner in the late afternoon, and if you're in Dublin, in the morning you can do any of the following: walk around the city centre and admire the buildings; take public transport (the DART) to Howth or Bray and walk around the headlands there, or just to Dun Laoghaire and walk the pier. 

I think the sales will start on the 26th December so there will be more people around the city centre then, and pubs and that will be open so you'll have more options for food and things to do in the evening. Regarding the tours you want to do, you'd be as well to contact the tour company directly about the dates you want to go on."

Walk around the town - it'd be the best time cos it'll be quiet.

The parks will be open, take a stroll around Stephen's Green, Phoenix Park, etc., walk along the canal..."
