        "I\u2019ve seen a lot of posts on this Reddit about how public transport in Ireland is terrible and not worth considering when travelling around the country. Sure there are gaps in coverage and now and again the bus in particular just randomly doesn\u2019t turn up or is already full or late ( mainly because the operators are having difficulties recruiting).\n\nThought I\u2019d start a thread here where locals and visitors could share their experiences. I have used intercity Irish rail, Dublin Bus , Luas and Dart extensively but have only limited experience using Bus Eireann. \n\nOverall,  it\u2019s not terrible in my experience, far from it. \n\nIrish rail is great value and reasonably priced for long distance travel. Transport in Dublin is fine- the 90 minute fixed fare is super though obviously what we have doesn\u2019t compare to larger cities like London in the reach and frequency. As a result the city can be congested though it impacts on all modes of transport especially buses and cars, the impact is less so on Luas and not at all on the dart.\nYou can make a reasonable argument that the buses and trains should have a lot more coverage and greater frequency but for the rail network what is there works really well, is fast, comfortable and for longer journeys is excellent value. As a for instance, the  train from Dublin to Galway booked online is \u20ac15 on a very comfortable train with a free seat reservation included. I think that\u2019s good value for a c. 200km, 2.5 hour journey and compares well to other countries. I\u2019ve paid far more in the UK for similar journeys. The petrol and motorway tolls to do that drive would cost you significantly more even driving a car you already own never mind having to hire one.\n\nAmong local users the satisfaction surveys are pretty good- see here https://www.transportforireland.ie/news/nta-publishes-results-of-customer-satisfaction-survey/\n\nAnd stats around reliability https://www.irishrail.ie/en-ie/about-us/train-punctuality-reliability-performance\n\nCan we get a more balanced and objective view to help visitors out?\n\nEdit: There is some great real world feedback below- consensus I think that Irish rail is grand, if sometimes crowded and getting around Dublin by public transport is also pretty ok (with the acknowledged lunacy that you can\u2019t reach the Airport other than by bus or taxi) but a lot of frustration with rural and intercity buses which are unreliable. Driving in Dublin generally won\u2019t make much sense to those unfamiliar with the city, it\u2019s fairly congested, parking is expensive and you\u2019ll find it easier to get around the city centre where most of the sites are on foot, cycling or using public transport than trying to drive.\n\nThere is also a view that getting to key (scenic) tourist destinations outside the cities like the Cliffs of Moher and Ring of Kerry using public transport is much more problematic- it\u2019s doable but relies on buses and can be slow which may not suit visitors whose time in Ireland may be constrained. A specialist day trip tour will likely suit your needs better. \n\nSuggestion: \n\nWhat would improve the rail system would be making easier to travel between regional cities, too much of the tracks radiate from\nDublin and it\u2019s a palaver with multiple changes to get (say) from Killarney to Galway.\n\nGiven Irish rail operate extremely expensive tourist rail tours there may also be an argument for more focus on scheduled tourist oriented routes and expanding the bus network around tourist locations. \nAs someone once said, build it and they will come.\n\nHelpful resources:\n\nPlanning a journey\n\nTransport for Ireland is the national regulatory authority for public transportation (as well as taxis and cycling) and has a good journey planner here.\n\nhttps://www.transportforireland.ie/plan-a-journey/\n (Google maps is often good also)\n\nLong distance trains\n\nBuy and and plan intercity train journeys on https://www.irishrail.ie/en-ie/. Best prices available online and fares are the same price at all times, varying slightly for the amount of flexibility you want usually ok to buy a day or so in advance but may be booked out at very busy times. Some routes can be busy so reserve seat in advance when booking online.\n\nYou get a code back by email and then collect your ticket in the machine in the station. You can opt to display your name or a reservation number over the seat in the carriage which will indicate its taken (not always observed but people will usually move when asked- generally Irish people are polite travellers but occasionally can be a bit raucous when in large groups say travelling to a stag do or a sporting occasion). You are not permitted to consume alcohol on board by the way.\n\nBut city to city train travel is usually cheaper, handier than driving and you\u2019ll see more on the train. Driving and train times are usually comparable on motorway routes and the train can edge it on routes like Killarney where there\u2019s a decent non motorway leg after Limerick. However, bear in mind the car gets you door to door where you may have local travel to book end your train journey which can slow you down.\n\nPlan long distance buses here https://www.buseireann.ie/\n\n(some feedback that timetables can be a bit loose and some popular routes in tourist areas may be busy so bear this in mind if your travel is time sensitive)\n\nTravelling around Dublin.\n\nArrival in Dublin by Air\n\nDublin Airport bizarrely is not served by train. Options are taxis (plan on \u20ac30 fare depending on traffic to City centre and time of travel) or express coaches. Obviously a taxi may work\nout cost effective for a group of 4.\n\nIf you\u2019re on a tight budget Dublin airport is also served by local buses 41 and 16 which are pretty regular (41 runs 24 hours) if you buy a regular leap card (see below) in the airport before you leave it\u2019s a \u20ac2 fare into the city centre, slightly more if paying cash and no change given of notes or credit/ debit cards accepted as of now (work\nunderway on this but it\u2019s at least a year away). \n\nHowever 16/41 are not a tourist bus and therefore luggage space will be limited so if you\u2019re hawking a large 20kg suitcase an\nexpress bus will better serve your needs.\n\nThere are also a range of long distance coaches serving other regional cities from the airport, some\ndirect and bypassing Dublin City.\n\nSee https://www.dublinairport.com/to-from-the-airport/by-bus\n\nGetting around Dublin\n\nDublin has three modes of public transport (all accept leap cards) as well as the Dublin Bike scheme which is very popular but limited to the inner city area.\n\nThere are also specialist tourist oriented city tour buses which allow you to hop on/off and have guide commentary. Heavily promoted in the city centre ( say on Dame Street in front of Trinity) and it\u2019s unlikely you won\u2019t see them.\n\nWalking tours are also very popular- look on trip advisor for the highest rated ones- usually provided by knowledgeable and humorous local guides.\n\nTicketing in Dublin public transport\n\nIt\u2019s not necessary/ possible to buy commuter bus, tram or local train journeys in advance. All can be crowded during rush commuter hour but you\u2019ll still get on (usually) though you might need to stand. As in any city at busy times pay attention to your luggage and be vigilant for pickpockets which are not unknown.\n\nBuy bus tickets from the driver (you can pay with coins or notes but you won\u2019t get change), you can pay for Luas or train tickets which are sold in machines at each Luas stop or train station. You can pay for Luas and train tickets using credit or debit cards but buses are cash only or tag on instead of buying a ticket using your leap card -\n\nSee below section on leap cards (both commuter and visitor )  for a convenient and low hassle approach to paying fares below. \n\nCity buses - generally ok but not super easy to figure out the routes/ stops- use the TFI route planner or see https://www.dublinbus.ie/home.\nFrequency is less good outside of peak times and the buses themselves are a mixture of new and old buses with some fairly shabby vehicles still in service (but bear in mind most journeys are short and they work ok as a means of getting to the many places not covered by Luas and Dart.\n\nTram is called the Luas and has two lines both of which traverse the city centre. Green line goes from Broombridge in Cabra on the Northside to Brides Glen in the south suburbs. \n\nThe red line goes from the 3arena in the docklands to Saggart and Tallaght in the south west suburbs. \n\nOff the top of my head I can\u2019t think of much tourist destinations on the Green line but the red line serves the National\nMuseum, Heuston (main intercity train station) as well as Kilmainham gaol. Guinness Storehouse/ brewery isn\u2019t too far from Heuston stop either.\n\nSee map https://luas.ie/assets/files/Luas_Map.pdf\n\nCommuter trains in Dublin are the Dart (running along Dublin Bay coast from\nMalahide and Howth in the North to Bray and Greystones in the south and the southern part is a very picturesque trip along an historic railway line https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin_and_Kingstown_Railway?wprov=sfti1) and Arrow serving commuter suburbs to the west of the city.\n\nDublin BIke Scheme\n\nThese are literally everywhere in the city centre and there are plenty of bikes available across the network of bike stations \n\n1 day pass costs \u20ac3.50, \u20ac5 for\n3 days \n\nThey\u2019ve added these short passes to the mobile app way of unlocking a bike which is the handiest\nOnce you\u2019ve bought a pass most journeys are free (you only pay for journeys lasting more than 30 mins and Dublin is pretty compact and flat) see https://www.dublinbikes.ie/en/home\n\nStudent/Young person travel \n\nInternational students (as well as locals) studying full time can apply for a student leap card https://about.leapcard.ie/young-adult-and-student-card-launch which gives a 50% discount on travel. A similar young adult card (no requirement to be a full time student) isavailable also and soon to be extended (early 2024) to those aged 19 to 25. Discounts for student/YA cards apply to all fares nationwide not just those in the Dublin leap card ( commuter/ short hop) zone.\n\nLeap Travel cards\nThere is a visitor leap card available which gives unlimited travel in the Dublin region at fixed prices\n\n1 day (24 hours) \u2013 \u20ac8.00\n3 days (72 hours) \u2013 \u20ac16.00\n7 days (168 hours) \u2013 \u20ac32.00\n\nThese prices are less than the daily caps for regular leap cards so if you\u2019re doing a lot of journeys they work out good value and you don\u2019t have to worry about running out of credit. \n\nA regular (non visitor)  leap card costs \u20ac5 and it makes most sense if you\u2019re only taking a few journeys which will be the case for many visitors as Dublin is compact enough to explore the city centre on foot.  if you\u2019re spending a few days in Dublin the regular card may work out cheaper than a visitor card for light use. Leap card credit can be topped up in rail stations or using mobile app. \n\nMain advantages of leap cards are not having to worry about coins on buses which dont take credit cards and don\u2019t give change of notes, flat \u20ac2 fare for 90 minute unlimited travel across multiple modes of transport and\ndiscounts on the cash fare.  \n\nBoth types of regular/ visitor leap cards can be bought in the ticket machines in train stations and many retail agents https://about.leapcard.ie/about/where-to-buy\n\nBut you need to visit a specialist Student Leap agent to buy a student or young adult card as these require you to prove eligibility and have a photo taken.",

        "I\u2019ve seen a lot of posts on this Reddit about how public transport in Ireland is terrible and not worth considering when travelling around the country.

        "I\u2019ve seen a lot of posts on this Reddit about how public transport in Ireland is terrible and not worth considering when travelling around the country.

        "I\u2019ve seen a lot of posts on this Reddit about how public transport in Ireland is terrible and not worth considering when travelling around the country. Sure there are gaps in coverage and now and again the bus in particular just randomly doesn\u2019t turn up or is already full or late ( mainly because the operators are having difficulties recruiting).\n\nThought I\u2019d start a thread here where locals and visitors could share their experiences. I have used intercity Irish rail, Dublin Bus , Luas and Dart extensively but have only limited experience using Bus Eireann. \n\nOverall,  it\u2019s not terrible in my experience, far from it. \n\nIrish rail is great value and reasonably priced for long distance travel. Transport in Dublin is fine- the 90 minute fixed fare is super though obviously what we have doesn\u2019t compare to larger cities like London in the reach and frequency. As a result the city can be congested though it impacts on all modes of transport especially buses and cars, the impact is less so on Luas and not at all on the dart.\nYou can make a reasonable argument that the buses and trains should have a lot more coverage and greater frequency but for the rail network what is there works really well, is fast, comfortable and for longer journeys is excellent value. As a for instance, the  train from Dublin to Galway booked online is \u20ac15 on a very comfortable train with a free seat reservation included. I think that\u2019s good value for a c. 200km, 2.5 hour journey and compares well to other countries. I\u2019ve paid far more in the UK for similar journeys. The petrol and motorway tolls to do that drive would cost you significantly more even driving a car you already own never mind having to hire one.\n\nAmong local users the satisfaction surveys are pretty good- see here https://www.transportforireland.ie/news/nta-publishes-results-of-customer-satisfaction-survey/\n\nAnd stats around reliability https://www.irishrail.ie/en-ie/about-us/train-punctuality-reliability-performance\n\nCan we get a more balanced and objective view to help visitors out?\n\nEdit: There is some great real world feedback below- consensus I think that Irish rail is grand, if sometimes crowded and getting around Dublin by public transport is also pretty ok (with the acknowledged lunacy that you can\u2019t reach the Airport other than by bus or taxi) but a lot of frustration with rural and intercity buses which are unreliable. Driving in Dublin generally won\u2019t make much sense to those unfamiliar with the city, it\u2019s fairly congested, parking is expensive and you\u2019ll find it easier to get around the city centre where most of the sites are on foot, cycling or using public transport than trying to drive.\n\nThere is also a view that getting to key (scenic) tourist destinations outside the cities like the Cliffs of Moher and Ring of Kerry using public transport is much more problematic- it\u2019s doable but relies on buses and can be slow which may not suit visitors whose time in Ireland may be constrained. A specialist day trip tour will likely suit your needs better. \n\nSuggestion: \n\nWhat would improve the rail system would be making easier to travel between regional cities, too much of the tracks radiate from\nDublin and it\u2019s a palaver with multiple changes to get (say) from Killarney to Galway.\n\nGiven Irish rail operate extremely expensive tourist rail tours there may also be an argument for more focus on scheduled tourist oriented routes and expanding the bus network around tourist locations. \nAs someone once said, build it and they will come.\n\nHelpful resources:\n\nPlanning a journey\n\nTransport for Ireland is the national regulatory authority for public transportation (as well as taxis and cycling) and has a good journey planner here.\n\nhttps://www.transportforireland.ie/plan-a-journey/\n (Google maps is often good also)\n\nLong distance trains\n\nBuy and and plan intercity train journeys on https://www.irishrail.ie/en-ie/. Best prices available online and fares are the same price at all times, varying slightly for the amount of flexibility you want usually ok to buy a day or so in advance but may be booked out at very busy times. Some routes can be busy so reserve seat in advance when booking online.\n\nYou get a code back by email and then collect your ticket in the machine in the station. You can opt to display your name or a reservation number over the seat in the carriage which will indicate its taken (not always observed but people will usually move when asked- generally Irish people are polite travellers but occasionally can be a bit raucous when in large groups say travelling to a stag do or a sporting occasion). You are not permitted to consume alcohol on board by the way.\n\nBut city to city train travel is usually cheaper, handier than driving and you\u2019ll see more on the train. Driving and train times are usually comparable on motorway routes and the train can edge it on routes like Killarney where there\u2019s a decent non motorway leg after Limerick. However, bear in mind the car gets you door to door where you may have local travel to book end your train journey which can slow you down.\n\nPlan long distance buses here https://www.buseireann.ie/\n\n(some feedback that timetables can be a bit loose and some popular routes in tourist areas may be busy so bear this in mind if your travel is time sensitive)\n\nTravelling around Dublin.\n\nArrival in Dublin by Air\n\nDublin Airport bizarrely is not served by train. Options are taxis (plan on \u20ac30 fare depending on traffic to City centre and time of travel) or express coaches. Obviously a taxi may work\nout cost effective for a group of 4.\n\nIf you\u2019re on a tight budget Dublin airport is also served by local buses 41 and 16 which are pretty regular (41 runs 24 hours) if you buy a regular leap card (see below) in the airport before you leave it\u2019s a \u20ac2 fare into the city centre, slightly more if paying cash and no change given of notes or credit/ debit cards accepted as of now (work\nunderway on this but it\u2019s at least a year away). \n\nHowever 16/41 are not a tourist bus and therefore luggage space will be limited so if you\u2019re hawking a large 20kg suitcase an\nexpress bus will better serve your needs.\n\nThere are also a range of long distance coaches serving other regional cities from the airport, some\ndirect and bypassing Dublin City.\n\nSee https://www.dublinairport.com/to-from-the-airport/by-bus\n\nGetting around Dublin\n\nDublin has three modes of public transport (all accept leap cards) as well as the Dublin Bike scheme which is very popular but limited to the inner city area.\n\nThere are also specialist tourist oriented city tour buses which allow you to hop on/off and have guide commentary.

        "We're planning a visit to Ireland in late March, visiting from the US (Oregon).  We're looking at two nights in Dublin, two nights in Belfast, and three nights in Southern Ireland (Kilkenny, perhaps).  Essentially, we're hoping to get a feel for the cities, visit the Titanic museum, and see some castles and ruins.\n\nWe're traveling as a family of six -- my wife and I plus our four \"children\" aged 20, 18, 16, 15.  \n\nI was looking at Aircoach for transportation from the Airport to the city center.  But we are also considering the DoDoublin hop-on/hop-off bus, and I noticed a \"Freedom Ticket\" that includes the tour bus as well as airport transfers.  \n\n* Are we able to take luggage on the airport transfers in the Freedom ticket? \n* Is the Freedom Ticket a good deal, with just two nights (\\~2 days) in Dublin?\n\nWe're also looking at lodging options, and Dublin hotels seems a bit expensive.  We found some reasonable priced options in Belfast, and I was surprised by the difference.\n\n* Are there any good, affordable Dublin lodging options we should consider for a family of six? \n\nWith the Freedom Ticket, we could use rail lines to access lodging options a bit further away, I suppose.  \n\n* Is it reasonable to look farther out from the city center for lodging in Dublin, relying on public transportation?\n\nAlso appreciate any thoughts on the southern part of the trip.  We plan to rent a car for these days, and had considered finding a bed and breakfast as our base for a few nights.\n\n* Any good recommendations for B&Bs that we should consider?\n\nThanks for any advice.  Really excited for our visit!",

        "Hello! We have a group of 13 that will be touring Ireland next August. I\u2019m currently leaning toward renting 3 larger vehicles and driving ourselves around but wanted to see what others thought. \n\nPros: can go wherever/whenever we want and cost effective\n\nCons: we are used to driving on the right (Wisconsin) and most of our group have not been to Ireland previously, so they are unaware of what a true narrow road looks like.\n\nAny other suggestions? Good private busses that could accommodate an already planned itinerary (From Dublin to Dingle seeing as much as possible in between)?\n\nThank you all!!",

We are going to be in Dublin(19-21), Cork(21-22), Dingle(22-24), Galway(24-26), and end again in Dublin(26-27).\n\nHoping to make public transit work for transport (if we can get the leg between Dingle and Galway to work\u2026looking into a few tour options to take us from one spot to the other with a stop at the Cliffs of Moher)\n\nI would love to hear advice on unique experiences in these places. Input on the typical tourist to-dos is also welcome but I\u2019d love to especially hear about the slightly off the beaten path experiences you\u2019ve had in these locations. We are a group of 6-8 that is down to try about anything.\n\nAdditionally, I love to take home souvenirs from trips that are very true to the place I\u2019ve visited. Any recommendations for places to stop in at? I\u2019ve seen so far Claddagh rings in Galway and I remember seeing a few things about wool items.\n\nEDIT:\n\nWould also LOVE recommendations for vintage stores in any of the cities we are stopping in. Another favorite way to bring home memories from a trip for me :-) ",
        "I was send here by the mods of r/AskIreland and hope some of you can answer me some questions and/or give me some recommendations.

If so, do you recommend any rental services over others and what would be the price range per day?\r  \n\r  \nIn Dublin ofc I'd like to see some of the main touristic sights, I wont ask much about them, but can you recommend anything besides that? Markets, pubs, etc. that are not full of tourists, I'd rather meet friendly local people, if they are friendly? Do people rather dislike tourists and foreigners or are they happy to meet some, if they dont behave like total cumstains? Any areas that are cool to see, any museums, theatres, places you recommend? I'm very interested in history, classic art and culture.\r  \n\r  \nWill there be a lot of action during the holidays, or is everyone with their families and shops, pubs, etc. are mostly closed? And any recommendation for a friendly pub where a lonesome foreigner can spend New Years Eve without being looked at like a weird figure? Any places you recommend to meet some cool people to hang out for a few days, while I'd be in Dublin?\r  \n\r  \nAny (cheap) places to stay you can recommend? I dont need much, but I'd prefer my own room with my own bed over a six bed hostel room, I'm not exactly a backpacker.\r  \n\r  \nFor the week after New Years I'd love to travel the countryside, see some cool nature, stay in some relaxed villages, with some friendly locals, a few sheep, an inn or an pub, especially if they might have a room to rent, so I can stay each night somewhere else and walk around in the nature a bit. Idk, any must sees or anyone from a superb village they can recommend to stay awhile and enjoy some traditional irish food? I dont need parties or anything special, just some calm and relaxation is what i need. Eat, drink, sleep, read, write, walk around, you get the gist? Smth smth pittoresque.

        "It will be my boyfriend and my first time to Ireland. We only have 3.5 days in Ireland in early/mid March. We\u2019ve been planning on staying in Dublin the entire time and doing a day trip to cliffs of moher (it stops in Galway for like, an hour as well) using a tour, but I\u2019m having doubts. We both really want to see more of the countryside, but we won\u2019t be renting a car. And obviously nobody can predict the weather but I\u2019m concerned that we\u2019ll dedicate an entire third of our trip to see the cliffs and we might not be able to see much if it\u2019s too rainy. I know we\u2019re so limited on time, and maybe we should just commit to Dublin and save the rest for another trip. We\u2019re doing London and Edinburgh on this trip, so I\u2019m worried we\u2019ll be city-ed out as Ireland is our last stop. Am I overthinking this? For reference, we like to see castles, outdoor stuff, eat, and drink lol\n\nEdited to add, our flight home leaves from Dublin but we haven\u2019t booked transportation arriving into Ireland, and the hotel we booked in Dublin is refundable ",

We both work as nurses so we don\u2019t have a lot of vacation time due to our seniority levels so we only have a max of 7 days off. \n\nHere are some of our questions:\n\n- How is public transportation like within Dublin and from Dublin to other parts of Ireland? (We will not be renting a car)\n\n- Where is somewhere besides Dublin that is easy to get too and that we can stay for a couple of days? (Can be around Ireland or a different country nearby) \n\n- What are some must-see\u2019s/must-try\u2019s in Dublin? \n\n- Is there anything else we should know about traveling around Ireland? \n\nThanks so much in advance!\n\nEDIT: I HAVE DONE SOME RESEARCH ALREADY BUT WANTED FRESH SUGGESTIONS/ADVICE - That is why this post is probably repetitive to most.

        "Hi all! I will be visiting Ireland for the first time next month. I am still searching accommodations in Dublin, arriving early Tuesday morning 14th of November and staying through that Friday night. So far I've found Agibail's Hostel for female dorms which seem nice but if there are any other women-only places to stay, please send your recommendations \ud83d\ude42\n\n\r  \nI am very much looking forward to all the public transportation \ud83d\ude0d And as of right now, I may very well end up taking a train or multiple trains each day that I am there (I am overwhelmed, looking at the train routes/tickets \ud83e\udd2f it seems you can cover a lot of ground (a lot of Ireland!) in no time at all and for very reasonable fare. \n\n\r  \nSo far, I've found a private, guided tour of IRA history in Belfast that looks to be very informative. I'm very interested in such things if anyone can offer further recommendations (IRA; other, perhaps lesser known, resistance movements/parties - past and present). \n\nAlso, while in Belfast, I would love to find out more about my great-great grandmother and her family; I only have her maiden name and per her birth record, \"born 1891 in Northern Ireland\". Are there any archives open to the public? Where could I go in Belfast or surrounding areas to track down such a thing? \n\n\r  \nI've also been reading about An S\u00fag\u00e1n Museum of the Irish language and Gaelic Revival - but I dont think they've opened yet? Any similar points of interests are welcome (history of Gaelic language or even classes open to the public) \ud83d\ude4f \n\n\r  \nArt museum recommendations please! \ud83c\udfa8\ud83d\udc9a\n\n\r  \nI will be checking in with IPSC for events \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddea \ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf8 but if anyone has info on similar organizations so that I may stay abreast of marches/rallies/etc., I appreciate it \ud83e\udd1d\n\n\r  \nThat's all I can think of for now! :3",

        "Hey everyone,\n\nI had been mentally entertaining a trip to Ireland for the past month. Like many others, I played around on google and other feeds to see Irish tourism at its finest. It lured me immediately and I was pumped but didn't immediately commit. I began gathering information about sights to see and things to do. Then... last night... I finally pulled the trigger on my flights. I'm heading over there for 8 days in mid-October and could not be more excited!\n\nHowever, as this all became more real, I began to do more research into the trip... and found myself very very confused. I've found Ireland's best to be scattered and while the transportation system looks great, it doesn't seem simple to get directly to all the top sights efficiently. On top of that, I feel as though I don't really even know what to see!\n\nWe (a couple, approx. 30 y/o) are no strangers to travelling around new and interesting places but this is our first time in Ireland. English is our first language so we should be safe there, but we also know some French if that helps at all :). We love exploring - whether it be natural wonders, city architecture, interesting exhibits/museums/tours/etc, or even food (we love seafood!). Unfortunately, we don't drive manual and also only have experience driving on the right side of the road so we likely won't be getting a rental car :( ... but we do enjoy some biking and hiking!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Mentally, here is where I am with the planning:**\n\n**October 9** \\- Arrive Dublin Airport in the AM, make our way to the city and drop bags at the hotel near city center Dublin before we go explore Dublin (Trinity College, Guinness Storehouse, explore Downtown, a Museum?, Jamison Whiskey, Pub/Dinner).\n\n\\>>>Question for you guys: Since we're staying downtown, do we need to consider transportation around the city or will we be generally ok with walking around?\n\nAlso in Dublin or Galway, I was hoping to catch a live Gaelic Football or Hurling match. Any chance my trip plans align with some local games? Cheers!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**October 10** \\- Enjoy a little more Dublin if time permits, otherwise head towards Galway! (I hear the City is fun and there's a ton of attractions nearby)\n\n\\>>>Here is where I start to get ABSOLUTELY LOST. I definitely want to do a trip to Cliffs of Moher and possibly the Aran Islands but I don't really know the best way to go about doing these. Would it be best to do a tour? Would it be better to do public transit and go solo? Also, are there other incredible places to visit in and around Galway that are highly recommended for first timers visiting Ireland ready to soak in some castles, geographical formations and landscapes?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFrom here on, I believe we want to do the following but get even more lost with our plans:\n\n\\>>>Dingle? Killarney? Kerry? Limerick? Cork? Kilkenney? My understanding is that most of our time on the isle should be spent on the western side.\n\n\\>>>Skellig? Ring of Kerry? Killarney National Park?

I definitely want to do a trip to Cliffs of Moher and possibly the Aran Islands but I don't really know the best way to go about doing these. Would it be best to do a tour? Would it be better to do public transit and go solo? Also, are there other incredible places to visit in and around Galway that are highly recommended for first timers visiting Ireland ready to soak in some castles, geographical formations and landscapes?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFrom here on, I believe we want to do the following but get even more lost with our plans:\n\n\\>>>Dingle? Killarney? Kerry? Limerick? Cork? Kilkenney? My understanding is that most of our time on the isle should be spent on the western side.\n\n\\>>>Skellig? Ring of Kerry? Killarney National Park? Blarney Castle/Stone? Other places I dont even know???\n\n\\>>>Make solo plans using public transport? Use any recommended tour services?\n\nThere's so much to do and I just feel lost putting my plans together here. Could some kind souls please help sort me out? Thank you so very much!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**October 16** \\- From wherever we are, finally arrive back in Dublin City (likely in the afternoon/evening and enjoy the city once more)\n\n**October 17** \\- Depart Dublin Airport in the AM\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you for listening to my quick brainmelt as I remain incredibly excited to visit the Emerald Isle! Absolutely cannot wait to be blown away :)",

        "Hi everyone, \n\nIn May '24, my parents (75 yrs) and my husband and I (51 yrs) will be visiting your fine country. This is my parents first time traveling out of the US ever, and my husband's first trip to Ireland.  (I spent five weeks there as an exchange student as a teen... 36 years ago. So, uh, I sort of feel disingenuous saying I have been there before. I have technically, but obviously so much is different. I was in Bray and saw a lot of the east, which I loved dearly, but I also have spent 36 years regretting not getting out west, and I know when my parents think Ireland they're thinking more like Ennis or Galway or Kenmare than they are Dublin... and honestly, I was a lucky brat to get to go and my mom and dad deserve to see nice things and have fun and I want to help with that, because they've been by and large lovely parents).\n\nWe have the larger details together. We fly from Boston to Shannon, spending a week in Killarney (taking the coach down... also doing the vast majority of the trip by public transport w/a few private tours to specific sites.) \n\nGoing to take the train from Killarney to Dublin, and while our hotel is in Killiney I don't have qualms about doing the train to LUAS to DART and then either bus/walk or maybe finding a taxi (my parents are in fairly good shape, but none of us have been known for athleticism or coordination, so it's hard to grasp how even minimal luggage might effect things. )\n\nI know Killiney is a bit distant from Dublin,  though not an impossible commute. We have Wednesday and Thursday planned out, and on Friday we head from Dublin ultimately to Ennistymon. My question is this: it seems we have a couple of options for the train cross country.  Would it be more interesting (or aggravating) to go from Dublin to Galway on the train, and take the 350 bus down to Ennistymon? If we stopped in Athenry (that seems to be an option) is there a West Clare type train/coach that could take us to Ennis and we could get a bus to Ennistymon from there? Would the travel from Dublin to Galway on the train look noticeably different landscape feature wise than the train from Dublin to Ennis? \n\nSince we're going to lose most of the day we travel from home base to home base to plain old travel time, I'd like for that train time to be part of the adventure of it all. I'd also like to have my parents have as less stress as possible (though their requirements seem to be seeing sheep, greenery and rocks, so I think they're going to love it instantly). But if there's a train ride back west that offers something a bit different than the sort of view one sees Killarney to Dublin, even if it is a little longer, that'd kick ass. \n\nWe will be leaving from Shannon as well, so no need to return east again. \n\nTl;dr Traveling from Dublin to Ennistymon with elderly parents via train/bus. What transport options do you all think have the best wow/uniqueness factors to make a mundane travel day something special? (And yes, at some point we plan on taking the 350 bus up the Clare coast just because it sounds that beautiful.)\n\nThanks again, all. I am so excited to come back, and I know my mom and dad are going to love it (forgive them if they are loud... they didn't used to be but *are* in denial about the hearing loss).",

        "Hello! I'm super excited to visit Ireland in October. I am American and have never travelled internationally. Americans are generally warned that the ludicrously huge rolling bags are a huge no-go in Europe due to uneven sidewalks, a lack of elevators, never ending steps, etc.\n\nI know packing light is always a must, but I'll need a medium sized checked bag because of the trip length. \n\nI'm flying into Dublin and will take public transportation to our hotels in the city. We are heading to Belfast on the commuter train for a few days as well. We'll be at three hotels total. \n\nWhat do you think: is rolling luggage functional enough for Dublin and Belfast? We're pretty able bodied so that isn't a concern, but I don't want to be annoyed by stone streets or a lack of elevators in metro stations.

        "Updated to add:\n\nThank you all so very much for your suggestions and tips...now that I\u2019ve had some time to do some research I\u2019ve added some details\n\nI will be coming in from Porto (or Lisbon), Portugal on Aug 01.  Ideally, I would prefer my trip ends closer to Cork (or anywhere that\u2019s less than 3 hours by train/bus) cuz the show is in Cork on Aug 10, and I would like to head back to Canada (Edmonton) on Aug 11 or Aug 12 at the latest.  I will not be driving when in Ireland, and I am currently looking through GetYourGuide to see what multi day trips are available...\n\nI am also not getting a data plan, and relying on WiFi, I dont know if thats a smart idea for a solo traveller?\n\n\\------------------\n\nHello!\n\nPicture this: a 13 year old kid in India doing her homework with TV playing in the background, and all of a sudden Michael Flatley's Lord of the Dance appears on screen and for an hour and a half she couldn't take her eyes off the screen and has been mesmerized since.  Here I am, 40, recently separated, and approaching life with a new mindset, I bought a ticket for the 25th anniversary of LOTD next month in Cork.  I am travelling solo to Azores, Portugal first for my friends wedding and then figuring out my way to get to Ireland.\n\nA few things I need help with:\n\n* what are some of the affordable cities I could check out fir the scenery or anything worth visiting, so far I have Cork on my list.\n* Are there hostels I could stay in that are safe.\n* If I was coming in from Portugal into Ireland, what would be the best way? Ferry, flight? I am from Canada and I have been looking at transportation websites in Europe and I\u2019m starting to get overwhelmed.\n* Do I make Dublin my last stop so I can fly back to Canada with ease, or are there other airports that are just as efficient?\n* Also, are there apps to meet local friendly people, or do I just take all my anxiety and go into a bar and talk to someone there? I feel like hanging out with some locals, would be an awesome travelling experience, just don\u2019t know where to begin! Any help is appreciated \ud83d\ude0a",

        "Hi all,\n\nin my current travel plans for travelling to Ireland with a group of friends, there were some changes, such that I will be the first of them, to arrive on late Friday afternoon at Dublin airport. The only thing that is fixed right now is that I will meet the next friend to arrive Sunday noon in Dublin, leaving me with \\~1.5 days to spend at my own pace.\n\nSo far, my idea was to visit Glendalough (I would love to do some hiking, ideally around some more ancient parts of Ireland). However, I'll have to rely on public transportation, and my plane will land just too late (touch down at 5pm, if it is on time) to catch the last bus to Glendalough from St. Kevins bus service in Dublin, leaving me with not really reliable options to get there at a reasonable time, or alternatively taking a cab for \\~150\u20ac at that time of day. So overall, this plan leaves me with a bit of a stomach ache, mostly because there are so many unknowns even before arriving at Glendalough - while it sounds doable in principle, it also sounds stressful.\n\nDo you have any alternative ideas for destinations to check out in such a short time?

The only thing that is fixed right now is that I will meet the next friend to arrive Sunday noon in Dublin, leaving me with \\~1.5 days to spend at my own pace.\n\nSo far, my idea was to visit Glendalough (I would love to do some hiking, ideally around some more ancient parts of Ireland). However, I'll have to rely on public transportation, and my plane will land just too late (touch down at 5pm, if it is on time) to catch the last bus to Glendalough from St. Kevins bus service in Dublin, leaving me with not really reliable options to get there at a reasonable time, or alternatively taking a cab for \\~150\u20ac at that time of day. So overall, this plan leaves me with a bit of a stomach ache, mostly because there are so many unknowns even before arriving at Glendalough - while it sounds doable in principle, it also sounds stressful.\n\nDo you have any alternative ideas for destinations to check out in such a short time? Alternatively I was considering just doing a guided bus tour to Wicklow mountains from Dublin on the full day, however I would prefer to somehow get the hiking part squeezed in, which is probably not gonna happen on a guided tour.",

        "Hello! I am visiting Ireland in mid February and am very much looking forward to it! Roughly here is my plan:\n\nFlying into Dublin, will spend a few days there.Take the train to Galway, spend 2 nights there.Then I must get from Galway to Doolin (planning on taking the bus?) where I will be staying so I can walk the cliffs. I will stay in Doolin Tuesday night.I fly back home Friday afternoon.\n\nMy question is what should I do Wed-Fri. I would enjoy something more nature/landscape focused than bopping around a town. How accessible is the Dingle Peninsula from Doolin? Will I have to rent a car? ---My initial hope was to rely entirely on public transport trains/buses because I am American and am anxious about driving on the left side of the road! But I am beginning to see what a time-suck that is. Should I try to rent a car in Galway, then I can drive to Doolin, then adventure out to Dingle / Kerry? Or is that too far? How should I get back to Dublin for my flight? Just drive all the way or drop the rental car off some place like Killarney / Limerick / ?? then take the direct train to Dublin.  (Of note, I don't mind \"long\" drives as I'm from the Midwest and would consider anything <5h relatively short, but I'm just more anxious about the narrow roads and wrong side).\n\nThank you for your help!

We are aware we may need to cut out the Dingle Peninsula or the Ring of Kerry, and are open to that. We'd love opinions on which to do, though, if we need to narrow it down.\n\nSat: Flight out 3:50, (layover \\~3 hours), overnight to Dublin.\r  \nSun: Arrive 7:45 AM in Dublin. Stay in Dublin.\r  \nMon: Rent car. Wicklow/Glendalough. Stay in Kilkenny.\r  \nTues: Kilkenny. Stay in Kilkenny.\r  \nWed: Dingle Peninsula/Slea Head. Stay in Dingle.\r  \nThurs: Ring of Kerry. Stay in Killarney.\r  \nFri: Cliffs of Moher. Stay on Inis Mor.\r  \nSat: Aran Islands. Stay on Inis Mor.\r  \nSun: Galway. Stay in Galway.\r  \nMon: Either stay in Galway again or return car to Dublin, stay in Dublin (stop in Athlone?).\r  \nTues: Derry. Stay in Derry.\r  \nWed: Belfast. Stay in Belfast.\r  \nThurs: Belfast. Stay in Belfast.\r  \nFri: Return to Dublin, flight out 1:15PM\n\nAlso, I love a good pub scene but no longer drink; is it easy enough to find non-alcoholic beers?

Leave from Shannon Airport. \n\nIdea #2\nWe will fly into Dublin & the spend the first part of our trip there. From Dublin, we will go to Dromoland Castle (via train or bus) for the second half of the trip and do a day tour to the Cliffs of Moher. Leave from Shannon Airport. \n\nI\u2019ve been reading a lot of your tips and many of you have suggested to station in two cities, so we are not sure if we should skip Galway and simply split our time between Dublin and Dromoland.  \n\nBased on your suggestions in other threads, these are some of the things we hope to see/do:\n\n- Dublin Castle\n- Christ Church Cathedral \n- St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral\n- Guinness Storehouse\n- Trinity College / Book of Kells\n- Grafton Street \n- Iveagh Gardens\n- St. Stephen\u2019s Green\n- Ha\u2019penny Bridge\n- Temple Bar district\n- EPIC\n- Day tour to Glendalough \n- Falconry/Hawk Walk (at Dromoland)\n\nI realize there\u2019s so much more to see, but don\u2019t want to spread ourselves to thin. \n\nAny suggestions at all (hotels, transportation, restaurants, etc) is welcome & greatly appreciated!",

        "hello! traveling to dublin from the 2-5 of january and am seeking some advice on two things:\n\nfirst, what are some restaurants you recommend? museums worth visiting? best bar/pubs that may still be slightly buzzing off the new year? (we are 23F and 24M and love a good time) -- open to anything !\n\nsecond, where are some good places to take a day trip by train or public transportation? its my boyfriend and i's first time in ireland and we want to try to see as much as we can. we have the whole day of the second and the fourth to see dublin, but wanted to use the third for a day trip. thoughts?\n\nthank you in advance!\n\nNOTE: i am aware that dublin may be coming off the high from the holdiays during this time period. that being said, is it still worth the visit? im assuming that there's never a bad time to go to ireland, so i hope you all feel the same way :)",
        "Hi all! My husband and I are in the early planning stages of a week-long trip to Ireland some time this August, and I'd love any general advice on things to check out while we're there. Activities, day trips, restaurants not to miss, all advice welcome!

Would love specific recommendations of Dublin/Galway restaurants that are gluten-free-friendly (I can tolerate some potential cross-contamination in the kitchen; I just probably shouldn't eat a piece of bread, you know?)\n\n\\- EDIT: We are not planning on renting a car, so will be relying on trains for transportation to and from Galway!\n\nThanks! Looking forward to any suggestions and recommendations.",

I'm also thinking about visiting the gap of dunloe, but I don't know if that would be too many day trips and I read online that there is a boat section and I do get seasick depending on the type of boat/water condition.

        "So as the title says, I'm looking into things I should plan in advance for a vacation to Ireland next year. It will be for a week in September of 2023 barring unseen events. I've never traveled out of the US before, so I'm trying to make sure I don't miss anything in my planning stage. Is there anything I should particularly avoid in terms of transportation and where to stay? What would you all say are the \"must-see\" attractions? Would it be wise to plan around a couple of hubs and do day trips from those throughout the week? Is renting a car worth it? Is the matchmaking festival that usually goes on in Lisdoonvarna worth checking out? Any tips that you may offer would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!",

        "This will be my first time in Ireland so im looking for any and all advice/tips. I am to get a tattoo done by an artist in Dublin during May and again in June to finish. So far I have only booked a round trip flight into Dublin for a suprisingly low rate ($470). Unfortunately the rates sky rocketed back to what I'm assuming is normal for the trip ($900-1k)? If you have any flight price hacks please let me know. I will be gone for a week in May and debating if I'll make my trip longer for June depending how May goes. \n\n- Is it worth it to hire a travel agent? I've never done it so I'm not sure what to expect if I did. \n\n- Currency:  Is it cheaper to convert USD to Euros in the states or in Ireland? I have to pay the artist in cash. Where do I do this? \n\n- Transportation: I don't plan to rent a car as it sounds terrifying to switch my brain to drive on the opposite side I'm used to, so I plan to stay in Dublin the whole time and use the bus and taxi system. The obvious drawback to this is lack of independence to go where I please. I was thinking of buying into the day trips to tourist destinations like The Cliffs of Moher. \n\n- What are the must sees/dos in Dublin and Ireland in general? Want to get as much of an authentic experience as one can. Any local spots worth a visit? Food/drink? \n\n- Where to stay? I'd like to stay close to downtown Dublin for under $120.\n\n- Any covid restrictions? I am vaxed and getting my booster soon.",
        "Hello all!\n\nThis will be my first time traveling to Ireland and also doing some solo travel.

I am working on broad strokes of an itinerary but am open to changing really anything.  I'd love some feedback/advice! I honestly am not sure what to do with my last couple of days. \n\nI have nothing in particular that is a must see, but from an interest's perspective I'd love to experience Ireland's music, food & landscapes.

It's also to hang with the wedding party. \n* I'd prefer not to rent a car by myself.\n\nDay 1 - Saturday June 24th - Galway\n\n* Arrive in Dublin early AM, catch bus to train station, head to Galway\n* Arrive in Galway by midday, explore the city, nightlife, etc. \n* Stay at an Airbnb or a hotel, undecided\n\nDay 2 - Sunday, June 25th - Galway\n\n* Take a day tour out of Galway to Connemara? \n* Back to Galway for nightlife/sleep\n\nDay 3 - Monday, June 26th - Galway\n\n* No set plans, any suggestions? any day trips or advice to jump somewhere else?\n\nDay 4 - Tuesday, June 27th - Doolin \n\n* Take bus #350 from Galway down to Doolin to meet up with rest of wedding party\n* try and get there early, might do doolin cave, burren walk, pitch and putt\n* night pre-wedding dinner with wedding party\n\nDay 5 - Wednesday, June 28th - Doolin \n\n* nothing planned for the daytime\n* evening - wedding @ cliffs of moher, dinner, reception\n\nDay 6 - Thursday, June 29th - Dublin\n\n* Wedding has a party bus going back to Dublin, will travel with group\n* Doing Guinness and dinner Thursday night \n\nDay 7 - Friday, June 30th - Dublin \n\n* Day trip to Northern Ireland via tour\n* see Belfast, giant causeway, etc. \n\nDay 8 - Saturday, July 1st - ??? \n\n* was thinking maybe take train from Dublin > Mallow > Kerry and seeing the Gap of Dunloe\n* Alternatively, I could travel south of Dublin to somewhere like Wicklow or Glendalough \n\nDay 9 - Sunday, July 2nd - ??? - any suggestions? \n\nDay 10 - Monday, July 3rd - ??? - any suggestions? \n\nDay 11 - Tuesday, July 4th - Dublin\n\n* Head back home to the US on an afternoon flight \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know this is a very rough draft but I'd appreciate any and all feedback! \n\nThank you!",

        "Dear All,\n\nI will travel through Ireland in June for 16 days. While the amount of time sounds long, I also like to take my time at a place, do day trips and don't like ticking checkboxes on a bucket list. I will also use public transport, as I'm not a confident driver.\n\nSo this is the plan, and I would like to know if this plan sounds good or if I missed great highlights:\n\n4 days Dublin\n4 days Galway\n4 days Killarney\n2 days Cork\n1 day Kilkenny\n1 day (preparing to got home) Dublin\n\nI left out Sligo and Limerick, because I think there will be plenty of possibilities to do day trips from Galway. Killarney, I think, will be a great place to do some bicycle trips. \n\nWhat do you think about Cork and Kilkenny?\n\nThanks a lot in advance!",
        "Hello everyone! My girlfriend and I are planning 10-days trip to Ireland in August. We'll use public transport because cars are way more expensive for that period. We have already booked all our trains and now we would like to also book the buses from Tralee to Dingle (and return) and from Ennis to Doolin (one way). When we select the tickets on the Bus Eireann site we can't reserve the seats for those two services (275 and 350).\n\nDo you know if there is any other way to reserve a seat on those buses? If there is no way to reserve the seats I think the only way to be sure to have a seat is to arrive in advance.\n\nIn your opinion those two services (275 Tralee - Dingle of 9AM, 275 Dingle - Tralee of 7:30 PM and 350 Ennis - Doolin of 5:30 or 6:30 PM) could be very crowded in the first week of august? How much time in advance do you suggest arriving at bus stations to be sure to find a seat?\n\nThank you in advance for your useful tips!",

It's on get your guide. I wasn't able to find it when searching but after contacting one of the tour companies they sent me the link to it.  \n\n\n\nOriginal post:\nHi all. Sorry if this has been asked a lot but when I search I keep getting from Dublin.\n\nI'll be in Galway June 13-15 although coming and going on the bookends. I would like to go to the cliffs on the 14th and walk. A lot of tours I see only stop there for an hour up to 3. I'm an avid walker and my plan was to walk the whole way ideally. I'm not interested in a tour that's only to stop and take pics then pop back on a bus.  \n\nAs I'm not willing to sacrifice my non-existent first born, I will not be renting a car when I'm there.  \n\nDoes anyone have any recs for tours from Galway? One that is focused on actually spending time there versus driving quickly past?   \n\nIs booking a taxi feasible? I saw Uber isn't a thing in Ireland so that idea is out.   \nGoogle tells me I can take a bus from Galway to Doolin. I'm from Canada, so public transport outside of 3 major cities is complete trash. Is the bus a reliable mode of transportation here? \n\nThanks for any thoughts or opinions",

When we get out, we get out). We will have a car for those first 3 days, so the world is our oyster, but we also know that Jetlag will kill me the first few days.

        "Hello all!\n\nMy partner and I are going to Ireland November 25-December 3 from Illinois, USA. Flying into Dublin.\n\nWas looking to get some help on planning on itinerary for it. We have our flights booked already. We also have a hotel booked for November 30-December 3 at a hotel in Dublin. We have a wedding on December 1, after party on December 2, and flight on December 3 so technically those three days are already set in stone and shouldn\u2019t be part of the itinerary.\n\nWe fly into Dublin on November 26th, early morning. Was planning on getting a hotel for the night and staying there for a day while we recover from jetlag and just explore the city. Potentially taking a bus tour so we could take the city in and figure out what else we\u2019d like to do at the end of the trip.\n\nNext, we were planning on either doing a day or two in Galway or Belfast, taking the train. We don\u2019t intend to get a car since we would like to just take it easy, and neither of us knows how to drive in a different country and think it will be a little confusing getting used to driving on the other side of the road, worrying about tolls, etc. So for now we just plan on public transport. November 27-28/29 would probably be spent in either of those cities but we need some help deciding on which one. We like nature, and would love to see the cliffs of moher but we don\u2019t know if that\u2019s doable without a car. We wouldn\u2019t mind booking a day trip so that we can go there, I saw a few online leaving from dublin but don\u2019t know if Galway has that option as well.\n\nThen we intend to take the train back to dublin on the 28/29 and get another hotel for the night in the city center and do some more exploring. 30th is check in for our other hotel thats a little farther away, and I assume we will be doing more touristy things/just relaxing on the 30th in dublin before we meet up with everyone for the wedding on december 1-2. \n\nI guess my main questions are:\n\n-How long should we stay in Dublin? Entire trip and just take the train around for a day trip to Belfast and Galway, then be home at night in Dublin? Or stay for a night or two in Galway/Belfast, before coming back to Dublin. Technically we only have 3 spare nights before we definitely have to be back in Dublin so not sure what best thing to do is.\n\n-If we should stay a night or two in another city, is Galway or Belfast recommended? Like I said, we like nature but also know that the weather won\u2019t always be ideal so we have to work around that. We also like architecture and strolling around cities so it doesn\u2019t have to all be about nature.\n\n-Any recommendations for must see things in Dublin? And also general recommendations for the country and things we should know/ things we should do or see (or eat) while there.\n\nThanks in advance!",
        "Hello, \n\nWe're flying out to Dublin in a few weeks and would be staying around a week in Ireland. While we're there we'd like to take a car and drive around the island on our own terms. Hence I'm wondering where would be the optimal place to rent a car in Dublin for 6-7 days which wouldn't cost us a kidney or two? What are regular prices to watch for when renting a car? Any other tips around renting a car?\n\nWe are planing to start at Dublin towards Birr Castle, Cork, Kerry, Connemara and if time allows it Ben Bulben and other things on the way, then back to Dublin. \n\nIs a car necessary at all to do such trip in a week time? Are we going to do fine if we rely on trains/busses instead of renting a car? How would it be price wise compared rented car vs other transport?\n\nThank you for your time and have a good one :)",
        "So this is a long shot but thought I would try. I booked a flight to Dublin for a few days back in November and from there will go to Barcelona for a few more days before heading back home to the US. This trip is next week 1/5/22 - 1/15/22. I'll be honest, I hate that I'm doing this trip during this time with COVID cases increasing and all the new restrictions, but canceling isn't really an option as I would lose out on a ton of money that I put into this. Planning to be extra cautious and safe, so hopefully all goes well! So unless United Airlines cancels my trip I'm still planning to do this. \n\nOriginal plan was to visit a friend from Ireland and meet in Dublin and then see my aunt in Barcelona. My friend in Ireland just informed me he isn't going to be available possibly at all while I'm there. So I'm trying to come up with some other things to do. I have a few things I want to see within Dublin using public transportation, but I'm also really wanting to see the Cliffs of Moher as well, which I know is quite a drive. I don't plan on doing a rental car as it doesn't fit the budget now, so was looking at possibly one of the bus tours? But those all seem to be full day trips with stops that I don't really want to do. I mean anything in Ireland is going to be great to see, I just don't want to do those extra stops, mostly for the sake of time and my limited stay in the country. Does anyone know if there are other tours that are \"half day\" Cliffs only or anyone going that I might tag along with or anyone just want to go? hah Obviously I'd help with fuel. Or any suggestions on finding people to do things like this with? I know this is kind of last minute. \n\nOr any suggestions on other places with great views that are closer and accessible without a rental car and easy to get to? I know Howth Cliff Walk is close and could be cool to see. \n\nThis is my first solo trip abroad and normally something I would not do alone. But we gotta take a risk at some point in our lives right?! A bit terrified, but also excited.",

        "Hello!\nI've already received some great birdwatching advice here a couple of years ago, managing to see the wonderful puffins (thanks again).\n\nNow I'm coming back to Ireland the last week of August. I'd like to know if there are any good birdwatching places \"near\" Dublin (let's say, reachable in 2 hours) in this season. I won't rent a car so I'll rely on public transport.\n\nAlso, I've read that Shenick Island is reachable on foot when there's low tide. Is that good for birdwatching? In that case, from which beach can I reach it and is there a way to go there by public transportation? \n\nI will appreciate every bit of advice!",

        "Hello! My husband and I are finally taking our 2020 postponed trip to Ireland this July. We are starting to nail down our plans and itinerary but aren\u2019t sure what to do about transportation. He isn\u2019t super comfortable driving in Europe and hasn\u2019t heard the best stories from friends who have unfortunately. I barely drive in the US as it is (living and working in cities for nearly a decade does that) so I can\u2019t really argue for it either. \n\nAnyway. I\u2019m wondering if anyone on here has taken a long trip for this amount of time via public transit? Do you have any tips or helpful resources, like excursions and day tours that are actually worth it? For reference we\u2019re looking to stay mainly in Dublin, Killarney, and Galway and venturing out from those hubs.\n\nI\u2019ve heard plenty of times the only way to see everything is with your own car, but I\u2019m just hoping to get some options. Thank you in advance!",
        "Hi all! Im in the very pleminiary stages of planning a trip with my girlfriend from Canada next spring... but nothing is set in stone and we're totally open to changing the plans.\n\nWe wanted to spend 3 weeks in ireland/northern Ireland and are trying to figure out how to get around. We looked at a map and some places we wanted to go/see and thought it would be cool to do 2-3 days in the following cities in this order (making a little circle... kinda). But again, we're not committed to anything, so im open to any suggestions. \n\nDublin->kilkenny->limerick->Galway->(maybe 1 night in smaller town in the county of Donegal)->londonderry Derry -> Belfast\n\nSurely, someone has done something like this before and i would love any suggestions. If anyone thinks its better to spend more time in fewer cities, i would also love to hear your thoughts on why!\n\nI started looking into doing this by rail/bus. I think the first portion of the trip is do-able but a bit more expensive than i personally initially anticipated (but that might just be me). Where it starts to fall apart is from Galway going north to Donegal. im thinking renting a car is my only option for that stretch, but its no so bad because that gives us flexibility to go to places along the coast. I would just prefer to avoid renting a car for the trip unless there are no other options or its WAY cheaper. \n\nSo my questions i guess: \n1.Thoughts on the route? Will i have trouble hoping from city to city? What should i expect to spend on transportation?\n2. What is your experience with getting around the country? anything a canadian might not consider (other than i should know how to drive stick)? \n3. Is the train worth it for a few bucks more compared to the busses?\n\nThanks in advance!",

        "Hello all, first thank you for taking the time to read this. \n\nSo let\u2019s get into it. I will be going to Ireland for a solo trip (my first one in Europe, I\u2019m beyond excited as Ireland is a destination that has been very high on my travel list). I will be arriving in Dublin August 30 and flying out of Dublin September 5 and have already purchased my ticket (I know 6 days, annoying). Originally I was going to rent a car and drive the Southwest portion on my own. Seeing as the automatic (can\u2019t drive manual) car rental prices are wayyy over my budget I decided against it, even though that would be my most ideal option I just can\u2019t see paying $2k for a car rental. \n\nI decided to stay in Dublin my first day and a half so the 30th and 31st since in fly in, in the morning. Then I\u2019m kind of completely lost. I\u2019m using everything to do research (Reddit, forums, trip advisor, books, maps etc.) but it\u2019s so overwhelming. And as many people instructed not to pack too much in, I\u2019m packing too much in. So decided to do the Paddy Wagon 4-day Southwest tour and stay in hostels from the 1-4 and then come back to Dublin for the night and depart on the 5th back to Poland. \n\nI would be willing to only stay a day in Dublin and leave the next day if I had to. I can cancel the tour 28 days in adjacent for a full refund. I guess my question is: will be better planning my own itinerary using the public transportation system and seeing all the important cities. If I were to create my own itinerary I have a rough idea of how I\u2019d want it to go. Dublin-Galway (Connemara, Doolin, Cliffs of Moher)-Kerry (stay in Killarney to visit the Dingle Peninsula) and here is where I\u2019m lost. \n\nIf I haven\u2019t lost you yet after this very long post please lend me your advice or opinions. I kindly appreciate it. Cheers!",

        "Hi there, hope you and your families are all safe during this challenging time.\n\nI am an American who has been \"stuck\" in Japan since Feb, before the travel restrictions were put in place. I would very much like to stay put in the Japanese countryside (no covid cases), avoid international travel and wait this terrible pandemic out. But Japan is not allowing me to stay, and for many reasons, I will not be returning to my home in the US, where I have not lived in more than a year. One of the few safe places that we are allowed to enter right now is Ireland. I get that there must be some friction (very understandable) from the Irish about foreigners entering your country during this time. I'm especially curious to hear from other non-Irish who have entered recently under similar circumstances. I have so many questions...\n\n1. What was your experience entering the country? Any issues with paperwork, immigration, or interactions with locals?\n2. What resources have you used to keep yourself and others safe during this time?\n3. Recommendations for places to stay in the first two weeks to self-isolate/minimize risk of spread? My criteria: sanitary, no bugs, good wifi, and under 1500 Euro for two weeks. If location is good, I'd be willing to stay longer.\n4. Do you anticipate being able to extend past 3 months? If things get worse, I really want to reduce the chances that I have to get on another airplane.\n5. Is it easy to purchase a used or affordable road bike? Trying to avoid public transport, so my main mode of transit would be bicycle.\n6. Any shortage of masks/hand sanitizer? I'll probably bring a months' worth from Japan, but might pack extra if it's hard to find in Ireland.\n\nMy plan is to enter Ireland first week of August. I'm not trying to go on a whirlwind tour of the country, though I do love eating at restaurants, so if it's safe and if I'm welcome, hope I can eat lots of tasty food and help out some local businesses. My hobbies are pretty socially distant in nature (cycling, hiking, eating, netflix). I'm very sorry if these questions have been recycled over and over again in this community. I know changes are happening every week so I would really appreciate anyone who could help me out with your recent experience. Cheers and stay safe out there.",

I'm especially curious to hear from other non-Irish who have entered recently under similar circumstances. I have so many questions...\n\n1. What was your experience entering the country? Any issues with paperwork, immigration, or interactions with locals?\n2. What resources have you used to keep yourself and others safe during this time?\n3. Recommendations for places to stay in the first two weeks to self-isolate/minimize risk of spread? My criteria: sanitary, no bugs, good wifi, and under 1500 Euro for two weeks. If location is good, I'd be willing to stay longer.\n4. Do you anticipate being able to extend past 3 months? If things get worse, I really want to reduce the chances that I have to get on another airplane.\n5. Is it easy to purchase a used or affordable road bike? Trying to avoid public transport, so my main mode of transit would be bicycle.\n6. Any shortage of masks/hand sanitizer? I'll probably bring a months' worth from Japan, but might pack extra if it's hard to find in Ireland.\n\nMy plan is to enter Ireland first week of August. I'm not trying to go on a whirlwind tour of the country, though I do love eating at restaurants, so if it's safe and if I'm welcome, hope I can eat lots of tasty food and help out some local businesses. My hobbies are pretty socially distant in nature (cycling, hiking, eating, netflix). I'm very sorry if these questions have been recycled over and over again in this community. I know changes are happening every week so I would really appreciate anyone who could help me out with your recent experience. Cheers and stay safe out there.",
        "Hi there, hope you and your families are all safe during this challenging time.\n\nI am an American who has been \"stuck\" in Japan since Feb, before the travel restrictions were put in place. I would very much like to stay put in the Japanese countryside (no covid cases), avoid international travel and wait this terrible pandemic out.

        "Hello all, my husband and I (in our 30s) are planning a trip to Ireland sometime next year (probably September) and I am working on our budget. Originally we were planning to rent a car, but from what I've read in this sub and online, it seems more complex than what I'm used to here in the US (rental insurance fees and all that). I haven't had a chance to dig really deep into various rental agencies' terms and conditions, but it seems like there are significantly more costs than the base daily rates I've found so far. Which I should have expected of course, but things are looking expensive...\n\nI am still going to research more into renting a car, but I was hoping to get some feedback about our (very preliminary) itinerary, should we decide to skip the car and use buses/tours instead.\n\nWe are hoping to spend about 10-12 days in Ireland. We would be flying in and out of Dublin Airport and be\u00a0mainly based in Galway. For the time we are in Dublin, there are a handful of things we'd like to see in the city and nearby. We are especially interested in seeing Newgrange and Wicklow Mountains/Glendalough. I found a few different tour buses that go to those places. After a few days in the Dublin area, we'd take a CityLink bus to Galway and spend several days there. One day would be a Cliffs of Moher/Burren tour day.\u00a0\n\nA couple things I'm wondering: Will we miss out on a lot by not having a car? I've already discovered there isn't an easy way to get to the megalithic sites in Sligo via bus (if someone has a clever suggestion about this, I'm all ears!), and we're interested in seeing some more countryside/national parks, castle ruins, etc. We also don't necessarily like the idea of doing too many official bus tours. I think the three I've listed are doable without feeling too rushed or getting too expensive. But then I wonder if it will all come out close to or more expensive than just renting a car? Of course I'll have to try to pin down an estimate for a car (plus gas) as closely as I can, but I welcome\u00a0any advice about car vs. buses and tour bus trips, specific tour buses/other transport to avoid, and sites we shouldn't miss that are easy to get to from Galway (via bus, train, or car).

Here's a little it of background:\n\nI'm considering taking a solo trip as a sort of artists sabbatical to Ireland this year and was hoping for location input that some of you may have. \n\nSome details about myself:  \n31 years old, female.  \nArtist with a focus in silversmithing and jewelry design.  \nU.S. based\n\nWhat I'm looking for:  \nSomewhere with easy access to get outside of Dublin city, with transportation options to Wicklow. Would love if there was quick access to the ocean or walking trails. Not so interested in popular tourist spots, safety is important. I enjoy small towns more than big cities, but I'll be traveling by myself and don't necessarily want to rent a car. Bray seems like a really obvious answer, but I'm wondering if there's something I've missed. \n\nMy art is heavily nature and music influenced, I use a lot of antique jewelry and silverware in my work, so it'd be nice to be in a town that has antique shop(s). \n\nI'd likely rent a home or stay in a bed and breakfast for about 5 days in one spot. \n\nAnyone have any ideas?\n\nI will likely fly into Dublin because that's the least expensive for me and I could spend a couple days there going to museums and whatnot. I'm not into partying or being out late, and I'm willing to use taxis, rideshares, buses, trains, etc. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you!",
        "Hi there! My partner and I are visiting Ireland late October and firming up plans. I've done a bit of research online and from other posts on this sub but would love your thoughts on this rough itinerary. We're less concerned about specific activities in each city/town and more trying to plan out our drives and making sure we're booking the right number of nights at each stop.\n\n**Day 1**: Get into Dublin Friday morning, spend the day in Dublin\n\n**Day 2**: Spend the day in Dublin and/or go to Howth\n\n**Day 3**: Get rental car, drive from Dublin to Galway\n\n**Day 4**: Day in Galway (This will actually be Halloween, which I understand is also a bank holiday so I'm assuming there will be lots going on?)\n\n**Day 5**: Drive from Galway to Doolin, see the Cliffs of Moher (stay in Doolin)\n\n**Day 6**: Drive from Doolin to ***Dingle*** or ***Killarney***\n\n**Day 7**: Do ***Slea Head Drive*** or ***Ring of Kerry***\n\n**Day 8**: Drive back to Dublin\n\n**Day 9**: Fly back to the US in the morning\n\nCouple questions I'd love to get advice about:\n\n1. Still trying to decide between the Dingle Peninsula and Killarney/Ring of Kerry. Wish we could do both but my gut tells me we should pick one and fully enjoy it. Leaning towards Dingle from what I've looked up. Any major differences between the two we should take into consideration?\n2. Does it make sense to get a rental car from Dublin and start our road trip there? Or should we take the train to Galway and pick up a rental car there instead?\n3. We'll be there for the Halloween weekend... any particular event(s) you'd recommend?\n\nBit about us \u2014 we're 2 guys (gay/LGBT nightlife recos welcome!) in our late 30s/40s coming from New York. Love all food & drink, from a homey pub to a fancy cocktail bar and everything in between. We're very comfortable with walking and public transportation, but also excited to get out of Dublin and drive in the country. Overall we prefer to wander around and discover interesting neighborhoods versus booking museums and tours ahead of time (although we're open to any must-see/interesting/quirky attractions). \n\nThank you all in advance and very excited to visit your lovely country soon. :)",
        "Hello!\n\nI will be visiting Ireland for the first time during my college spring break, on a solo backpacking trip to Dublin. From Los Angeles (where I currently am) I will first travel to London to visit friends, then to Dublin for 5 days. Been planning this for months now so I'm super stoked!\n\nI've got a couple questions that I'm hoping kind redditors such as yourselves can help resolve!  \n\n\n* Besides going to pubs, what's the best way to meet locals and experience local culture? I'll be doing a fair bit of solo exploration but I definitely want to find people to do things with! Are tours with volunteer guides still a viable option?\n*  I know this is a sensitive topic, but I didn't want to assume the worst of people anywhere, so I'm asking here. As an ethnically Asian person, should I be concerned about explicit racism during my stay given the context of the coronavirus? A number of friends have warned me about the heightened level of racism in London, so I'm simply asking as a precaution since I'll be in Dublin alone.\n* I won't be renting a car, and I'm a huge fan of public transport! Any tips about getting around the city, either on foot or by bus/rail?  \n\n\nThanks so much for your time!",
        "Hi Everyone!\n\nSo we've finally saved up some money to travel to Ireland for our holiday. It's been a long dream of ours, so we're very glad that it might happen finally (especially that we are both vaccinated, so we will be allowed in hopefully). We have no specific destination, but we have a few ideas. I'd like to collect some suggestions from the fine citizens of this beautiful country.\n\nOur plan is that we arrive by plane in the middle of August, and stay for around 10-12 days. Our ideas:\n\n* Looking around in Dublin --> ideas are most welcome, what is a must see, how long would be ideal, etc. If we rent a car for our stay, should we get it already for Dublin, or is public transport / taxis better for that day/days?\n* We want to rent a car, and drive around the country. No specific destination. But most importantly, no highways, only small roads with the beautif scenery. We would stay in a different town every day / every 2nd day. We're open to every suggestion what places you consider the best. We are not looking for 4-5\\* hotels.\n* We would like to visit actual local places, like pubs, and so on. (We are not the party all day type of people, so no night clubs)\n* We would like to go hiking too maybe\n* If we buy presents for our family at home, we'd like to ship them home with a packaging service (when I worked abroad for half a year once, I did this a lot. So I'm looking for a reliable postal service)\n* We don't want to see everything right now. We'd be very glad to come back some other years too.\n* I'm not a tough guy, so we'd like to avoid rough neighbourhoods (if there are any at all)\n\nWe are open to every suggestion, and I'd love to hear it from those, who actually live there. Thank you very much in advance!\n\nOne last point: I might propose to my girlfriend of 5 years, so if you have a perfect place for it, that'd be also a highly welcome suggestion.",
        "A close friend of mine unexpectedly passed away recently and has had his funeral in Ireland followed by a burial.\nHe and I bonded over politics and he cheered me on to vote and was a very involved visitor \u2014 one that America would have been proud to make its citizen someday.

I will fly into Dublin.\n\nI, of course, want to do this compliant with all local laws, and applying for all the right permissions \u2014 how should I go about it?\n\nWhat modes of transportation can I hire from Dublin to his grave and back that will still be compliant under Level 3 restrictions? \n\nIdeally, I am happy if I am able to visit his grave, if only for an hour and return back and even just climb back on a return flight to NYC. \n\nI was also looking at flying into Shannon \u2014 far closer to his grave and also being the same county. But there are no options for SNN from NYC. I am happy to consider alternate routings if you folks feel flying into SNN is my best chance.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated. I am happy to file out my detailed plan with any Irish government department or get in touch with them and want to do this in the most rightful, compliant, and safe way.\n\nAnd it would be a personal closure with a great friend who was taken way before his time. \ud83d\udc94\n\nPlease advise me.\nThanks in advance!",

It seems very interesting, is it worth the cost?** \n* **QUESTION 3: Is an electric bike a good option to explore Slea Head and surroundings?**\n* **QUESTION 4: We could spend only a few hours in Limerick and Ennis, do you have any must see to suggest in those two cities?**\n* **QUESTION 5: From Doolin we would like to do some of those activities based on weather conditions and availability: to take the ferry to Aran Islands and rent two bikes for exploring one island  / to go to the Cliff of Moher by foot or bike or bus / to do a sea kayak tour in the area with North Clare Sea Kayaking. Do you have any suggestions or experiences about them?**\n* **QUESTION 6: We could spend only a few hours in Galway, do you have any must see to suggest in this city?**\n* **QUESTION 7: Is it a good idea to book train and bus tickets in advance for our trip?**\n\nIf you have any other suggestions about our plan you are welcome! Thank you again!\n\nTrip\u2019s plan:\n\n* ***Day 1 - Saturday - Arrival in Dublin***\n\nWe plan to arrive in Dublin around 6 PM, take a bus to Dublin Heuston, eat something fast and sleep in a BnB near the train station \u2018cause the next morning we want to take the first train to Kllarney.\n\n* ***Day 2- Sunday - From Dublin to Killarney***\n\nTake the direct train from Dublin Heuston to Killarney (Irish Rail) at 8:30 AM and arrive around  11:30 AM. We would like to stay in Killarney until Day 5 to explore the city, and the national park. \n\nSleep in Killarney\n\nPlanned activities: Do the bike on boat trip through the lakes and take the famous journey through the Gap of Dunloe. \n\n**(QUESTION 1)**\n\n* ***Day 3- Monday + Day 4- Tuesday - Killarney***\n\nVisit the park.

        "My wife and I will be traveling for the first time to Ireland at the end of October for 10 days. We have decided to split the time between galway and Dublin evenly. \n\nIn galway we have decided on Victoria hotel which is in Eyre Square. Being smaller, we have read that it's best to stay within the city center, especially since we'll be relying on public transport. On our stay, we will want to do day trips to Cliffs of Moher and Connemara. If weather permits, possibly fly to Inishmore. And just soak up the city the rest of the time. And quite possibly get soaked with the rain. But rain and wind doesn't scare either one of us. \n\nFor Dublin we're a little torn of whether to stay in the City Centre or in one of those seaside villages that are accessible through the Dart system. Our plans are some distilleries, museums and just learn about the history of your great country. We love to just hang out and explore the places we travel to without too many plans.  We don't necessarily need to be out partying all night. We much prefer a nice pub to have a drink in vs a crowded club or anything like that. Any recommendations for hotels in Dublin would be greatly appreciated. Up to 150$ per night would be OK. And we don't mind being out of the city center so long as it lays within easy access to your Dart line as we plan to get the visitor pass for our visit. We will  would definitely entertain any city Centre options. Being first time visitors, we think that may be for a better experience. Who knows. We're just a little lost for reservations in Dublin. \n\nSo far, our Dublin hotel choices are The Arlington, Ashling Hotel, Jury's Inn Christchurch, and Sandymount. \n\nAs for seaside towns we've read good things of Royale Marine Hotel in \u00a0D\u00fan Laoghaire and the Grand Hotel in Malahide. \n\n\nThank you for your time reading this and your suggestions in advance.\n\nEdit: think I have the luas and dart system confused. Apologies. I'm referring to the rail system for public travel around Dublin.",

We don't know if doing a small group tour is the best way to go or maybe finding a place to plant ourselves for several days and then taking short day trips from there.  Any suggestions would be great!   I have read that flying into Shannon vs. Dublin is the way to go for what we want.",
        "Hi guys!\nMy girlfriend and I were hoping to visit the Emerald island in late April or early May for 7 days. Since we are from Croatia there are numerous flights to Dublin but our main concern are the prices of apartments in Dublin. Since we are students we are traveling on a limited budget and are wondering if there are any villages or small towns near Dublin that would have cheaper prices for apartments? We were also hoping to get that Irish nature expirience.\nWhich brings me to my next question. Is it worth renting a car?\nSince we are hikers we were hoping to explore the nature around Dublin and also go as far as Belfast.\nSince UK called quits on the whole EU deal how is the situation on the border? Is it easy for tourists to cross it? Is it better to rent a car for what we are planing or to go by bus/train?\nAnd last but not least...hows the situatuon with the virus?\nDo we need anything more than 2 vaccines?\n\nMuch appreciate.",

        "Bus eireann extremely unreliable Allow a lot of extra time if you need to be on time and avoid for intercounty travel (very slow). Private buses to and from Dublin oversubscribed (Aircoach, Gobus, etc.) and need to be booked in advance. Expressway really overpriced. \n\nLuas, Dublin Bus, Dart and Irishrail are decent. Irishrail and Dart are a bit outdated",
        "Yeah even in towns like Athlone that got the new electric buses and there\u2019s a town bus that supposed to be going every half hour and yet people are just left standing in the rain not knowing when it will come. It would be nice if they could at least announce bus route cancellations or delays so people could have the chance to make alternative plans rather than waiting for a bus that\u2019s not due to show up for another hour or two.",
        "Last year I was supposed to get a car service pickup from Dublin Airport to Donegal Town.   The company, Blacklane, bailed on me, sending me a message while I was sitting in the airport.  Fortuantely I remembered that there was a bus that would take me to Donegal town though it took forever to find someone who knew about it.  Once  I got on it for about 20 Euros it was perfectly pleasant.  I took the same bus to Donegal Town again this year.   I've also taken the Feda Bus from Donegal to Galway which is a nice ride.  I've taken the train between Dublin and Galway and Dublin and Killarney and all of these had nice scenery to view on the way.  \n\nI was also able to get around Donegal, which has no rail service, by using a local bus.  I traveled twice to Glencolmcille to take photographs which worked out very well.  \n\nMy other favorite place to travel is Newfoundland, and I only wish they had the kind of public transportation that even Donegal has.",
        "Irish Rail: Good but too overcrowded during peak hours\nDublin Bus: Mixed bag, experience largely depends on the driver if you need assistance\nBus Eireann: Not to be relied upon\nLuas: Ok but not enough trams during peak hours\nDart: Dated but ok service",
        "I've been staying in Maynooth for about 2 months on a short study and I've gotten by just fine without a car. I've visited Cork, Sligo, Newry, Dublin, and Glendalough and have plans to visit Galway, Mayo, and Kerry over the next month before I leave, and it's all been via public transport. \n\nOverall, I find that Irish public transport is poor by European standards but much, much better than what I'm used to back home in Texas. If you're coming to Ireland with a particularly rural itinerary a car is a fine idea but it's by no means a requirement if you just want to see the major cities and tourist spots. Especially for tourists from countries that drive on the right and have predominantly automatic transmissions, I just don't see the need to go through the stress and danger of adapting to a whole new driving system.",
        "I had nothing but good experiences with the one exception of getting to and from the airport in Dublin. Also it's kind of weird that the airport in Kerry was built kind of far from the nearest rail station.",
        "I personally thought the Irish trains and buses were excellent. Used both in April and May around Dublin to Waterford, Kilkenny, Tramore, Cork, Killarney, Galway, and spots in between. The passengers and  operators were so polite and welcoming. Also, all were very clean.",
        "If you live outside Dublin and you\u2019re route isn\u2019t on any of the train lines, you\u2019ll realised Bus eireann are very unreliable. Even in cities in Cork when there\u2019s supposed to be a bus every 20 minutes, you can end up waiting an hour or more for a bus that won\u2019t show up. I understand traffic plays a part at certain times but outside peak hours there seems to be an issue with ghost buses.",
        "Yesterday I was at Spencer Dock luas Station. You can see the final stop (the point) from this station.  The board  said emxt luas in 11 mins then after 11 minutes passed went back up to 8 mins. Then after the 8 mins passed sat at due for another 12 minutes (I was timing it at this stage).\n\nThe whole time a luas was sitting at that final stop but never moved and what's more it was joined by another TWO there afterwards.\n\nSums up public transport in my book",
        "I often get the trains on the dublin to cork line. The new rolling stock is comfortable and all of the trains are clean. The old rollingstock that does the full route needs new seats, but again, it is clean. \n\nAll irish rail services seem to be reliable. \n\nThe issues are the speed and lack of onboard services. \n\nI can drive between dublin and cork in almost the same time as the train journey takes. Once you have added in any travel at either end, it is usually quicker to just drive. \n\nThe wifi needs looked at also as its poor.",
        "The public transport operator in Northern Ireland is Translink if you are heading across the border www.translink.co.uk",
        "I use public transport quite a lot and it doesn't tend to let me down too much. I think if you are prepared to do a bit of research and adjust your plans then you can have an okay experience, but really we shouldn't be at a point where that has to happen. The government and transport companies look at passenger numbers and think it is as high as can be be, rather than realising that there's a ton of people out there who would use it if they didn't have to wait two hours between services. The same problem is the reason they don't replace connections through the capital with direct services: sure people don't go from Cork to Sligo now, so why bother? It's this attitude that needs to change at all levels of power, otherwise we will be three decades down the road and Dublin will still dominate the country with all the current issues that it brings. Getting any form of public transport between cities is always going to be cheaper than the car, but the car drops you at your house not in a windswept station with no facilities and relying on a connecting service to finish your journey.\n\nIrish Rail is very cheap compared to the UK, the problem is simply one of capacity and frequency. Things like staff, engine and driver numbers will always impose an upper ceiling on things but Irish Rail doesn't seem prepared to ramp up train numbers to bring in any latent demand. They think that the 9pm train being quiet is a reason not to put on an 11pm one, rather than realising that people are simply driving because there's no other option.\n\nThe intercity coaches are a good fallback if you need to get somewhere later at night, but my experience of these is solely travelling between Dublin and another city. You might get lucky if you happen to be on the end of a spur, so Limerick to Ennis or Cork to Tralee, or somewhere on the way, like Kildare village, but outside of that you are screwed. That said, I find the intercities are reliable and cheap, but as somebody else said, interacting with the driver on a basic question can drastically change your opinion. I don't know if it's because some services are government-run or because there is a driver shortage and they can get away with it, but the way some speak to passengers who are being polite and asking sensible questions is shocking. I totally understand that there are plenty of arsehole passengers too, but I actually see less of those compared to drivers kicking off.\n\nIn the cities the bus problem for me is that they simply don't run late enough, and then you are in the hands of taxi drivers who are openly turning meters off because they are never inspected. Same problem with the Luas and the Dart, which only cover a minority of the city anyway. Again I find the fares cheap, it's like 1.35 or something in Limerick, but I can imagine having to connect between services is no craic. Also I find the bus drivers seem to be much less unhinged than the coach drivers, although I figured they'd have much more reason to hate every passenger they see.\n\nFor my pipe dream, I'd have every city north and south connected by a direct service, as well as every university, port and airport. I'd have most of the arterial carriageways and all circular routes in Dublin, Cork, Belfast, Limerick, Derry and Galway have a tramline in the bus lane. Dublin has already re-designed the bus network based on this system. Any major European city, and most of the smaller ones, have this system. Lisbon had a massive tram network right across the oldest parts of town where routes wind around tiny hillside streets, the particular trams are smaller in those parts but even Porto, Prague, Cologne, Milan and Stockholm all have this. I've never used the rental bikes and scooters as I have my own and live in a small city, but I see plenty of young people and loads of tourists using them, probably a good alternative to ramming a bike into a one-bedroom apartment. I'd also personally collect and bury every single Leap card at the bottom of the sea and replace it with a contactless system that is seamless between services, meaning you get off a bus and onto a bike within 90 minutes and it is a single charge. \n\nWe have to be serious about climate change but even if you don't give a shit about that, these are all things that exist in plenty of other places that we like to group ourselves into, and plenty of others we don't. For a small country with no major environmental challenges of freak weather events to contend with, as well as a massive budget surplus to spend, we should have a significant headstart on most other places, but we're crippled by parochialism, short-termism and a lack of strategic thinking. There's finally work being done on a rail link between Limerick and Foynes, and it only seemed to get over the line because they don't want rich Americans stuck in traffic for the Ryder Cup. The operator at Foynes and the EU was pleading with the government to re-open the line, and when they finally decided to, they forgot to survey the part of the line that goes to the cement factory. We're talking 2 or 3km of track that could take major freight traffic off the road, but as usual everyone thought it was somebody else's problem.",
        "A lot of people who think dublin public transport is bad have never been to similarly sized cities in the US. Compared to them you\u2019d wonder why anyone drives here",
        "If you're flying in internationally, your carbon footprint for the holiday starts off high anyway. Just throwing that in the mix. \n\nThe thing with public transport is that it's not designed, the routes, for tourism. It likes the large urban centres, patchily sure, but if you want to get to say, the Cliff of Moher it doesn't do that easily.\n\nPublic transport requires time. Time that a lot of people on short vacations can't afford. Hell, we also tell them not to try drive the entire country in 4 days too because there's a balance, as in all things. \n\nAlso, accessibility. Coach buses that traverse the country every day have either no, or extremely limited accessibility, so if you've a mobility issue, or a bladder issue tbh, coach transport can be really hit or miss. The trains don't go everywhere, can be overcrowded and at times, fucking expensive for what you're getting and while the trains themselves have way better accessibility, getting on and off them, and out of the stations even can prove very challenging for wheelchair users or people with ambulatory restrictions. \n\nTaxis, again, accessible taxis are few and far between. And if you have to go far in one, that's the cost of a car rent far the day even. \n\nPublic transport is a great way to move a lot of people, but they also aren't the best way for everyone. \n\nSo everyone needs to evaluate their needs, wants, time and budgets to go with the options that work best for them.",
        "I would highly advise against using public transport in Ireland for a number of reasons.\n\n\n**1. Expensive**\nIn comparison to other EU countries, it's ridiculously expensive. The train costs \u20ac22.50 to get from Dublin to Westport (probably more now) - in comparison, in France, you can travel a similar distance near Montpellier for \u20ac1. Buses here are also crazy expensive compared to the rest of Europe. It costs more to travel from Shannon Airport to Galway than it does to take a flight from Spain to Ireland.\n\n\n**2. Lack of Quality**\nI took a bus two weeks ago, there was one empty row at the back, when I got there, the entire seat was broken and pulled away from the back. You'll find the depths in the windows covered in years of dirt, not to mention the smell of shite. The same goes for trains. You'll have a sore arse after an hour journey.\n\n**3. No Country for Students**\nThe NTA (The Irish body for national transport) recently banned all student cards for travelling, allowing only a special paid card which cannot be availed of by any student outside of Ireland (and many within Ireland, because lots of universities have recently changed their name and the system hasn't updated it). It's a 100% reduction. Ireland is the only country I've come across, which doesn't offer a student discount for international visitors.\n\n\n**4. Loud Passengers**\nPublic transport in Ireland is unique in comparison to the rest of Europe, in that loud noise is generally accepted. One of the biggest changes for me living in another country coming from Ireland is how quiet public transport (in particular trains) was.\n\n\n**5. Never on Time**\nPublic transport in Ireland is never on time, I have literally never taken a bus or train that arrived and departed on the time it was meant to. Generally, it's 20 minutes on either side of the expected time. Drivers don't give a shite, I was once on a bus which was an hour late and the driver got off to get a takeaway halfway through the journey.",
        "Fair I thought but you can mostly get over the overcrowding on Irish rail by pre booking a seat. Occasionally you\u2019ll find your pre booked seat occupied but they will normally mooch off when you point out that you have it booked and for me yes the Luas needs to be more frequent and they need to manage anti social behaviour better but otherwise it\u2019s fine if limited in reach. Personally I think the Dart is fine, it\u2019s short duration transit- the fact its a bit dated doesn\u2019t bother me any more than the fact that my underground carriage in London might be 40 years old",
        "Great point- Irish rail and Translink jointly operate the Enterprise train between Dublin and Belfast and you can buy a ticket for this route from either provider but for other journeys in NI see the Translink site above.",
        "Seriously, even France has worse public transport than Ireland outside the big cities",
        "Excellent points, well made thank you mod!\n\nIn response to some of the above comments, my purpose here was to get past a simplistic \u201cDon\u2019t even bother looking at public transport in Ireland\u201d narrative which is wrong\u201d to a nuanced and informative discussion of where it might be a useful option to consider.\n\nOn the carbon issue, the carbon impact of seven million plus visitors arriving is fixed (no other way for say North American visitors to get here for example) but the impact while here is at least partially an impact of the transit choices they make while they are here. \n\nI still maintain that trains are good value- in my experience the cost for a couple of a journey between cities is usually comparable or less than driving your own car when you factor fuel, wear and tear and tolls and significantly less than hiring a car but as you say, it only gets you so far and starts to fall down badly when exploring many of our most popular sights like the Ring of Kerry, Connemara and the Cliffs of Moher. \n\nI just wanted to put out there (acknowledging the very valid points you make about those with more limited mobility) that you can cover a lot and have a very enjoyable experience using trains to move between cities and then selecting some well chosen day tours by tourism oriented operators or by hiring a car locally to access the harder to reach spots.",
        "I\u2019ve done the Cliffs by public transport in a day from Dublin. It\u2019s actually quite doable from Dublin, Limerick and Galway (maybe even Cork, I don\u2019t know). The bus to/from the cliffs isn\u2019t very frequent but it\u2019s often enough to allow a day trip. I\u2019ve even done Aran Islands as a day trip from Dublin. I don\u2019t know what planet people live on thinking these places are unreachable by public transport",
        "I would add to this very well made point that renting a car in Ireland has the enormous advantage that you can actually enjoy the countryside, stop at a random farm selling honey, reach that remote cliff or viewpoint, or that remotely located pub, without worrying that you won't have a bus to go back to your hotel or that you'd have to wait for X hours for one. Even reaching some B&Bs would not be possible without a car. The railway network is extremely limited in Ireland (in fact we had a larger network a century ago), so bus is the only option. Driving the small rural roads dotted with sheep is an experience in itself, and the cost of renting is also not so bad if sharing between 3-4 people and outside of summer months, in fact it can end up being cheaper than a train.",
        "You\u2019re obviously entitled to your opinion here but some fact checking on your points:\n\nCost- It would seem your experience of fares is somewhat out of date.\n\n A ticket on the SNCF website from Montpellier to Toulouse (slightly shorter distance to Dublin to Westport ) costs \u20ac15 to \u20ac38 depending on time of day. Dublin to Westport has been priced at \u20ac16 for some\ntime and is available on all trains if booked in advance.\n\nStudents- overseas full time students are entitled to apply for a student leap card just as Irish students are which gives significant discounts (50%) and it only costs \u20ac5 so it would most likely pay for itself in first journey.\nA little overhead in collecting it, admittedly (you have to show eligibility documentation to  a Leap card agent) but there was a perception that student cards were being abused previously (I know some night students who applied for and use them for example) so they have obviously tightened up on their issue.\n\n\n https://about.leapcard.ie/young-adult-and-student-card-launch#eligible. \n\nI have family members who just started studying in a number of the universities who recently changed name (SETU, ATU, TUS) and they all had their student leap cards up and running a few weeks into term. \n\nPunctuality- you may have been extraordinarily unlucky but average punctuality on the Irish rail intercity network (defined as arriving within 10 mins of schedule) is currently averaging about 92% with reliability close to 100%. Buses as a number of posters have noted are considerably less reliable and punctual.",
        "There are massive capacity issues on some Irish rail trains e.g. Galway-Heuston service. The middle carriages will be packed full of people and then you have lots of seats booked by travel pass holders, particularly this time of year. \n\nDated doesn't really bother me on the Dart either but some of the carriages are in awful shape. Some of the underground trains are very dated but it's a far superior service to anything we have here.\n\nAlso, for tourists, public transport isn't that important unless you're just going to stay in Dublin. Most people will just rent a car as we have a disjointed public transport network. MetroNorth will solve some of the problem but it won't dent the car rental market at Dublin airport IMO.",
        "I think the train service has certainly improved in the last year and to be fair, they have always maintained a tight schedule. By far it's the best form of wheelchair accessible travel, I know some stations are inaccessible and there's issues with ramps to get onto the train but the staff are excellent and do their best, plus there's a whole series of issues with the size of our railway guage that would pose challenges for fully accessibility. Now, Bus Eireann, as one poster rightly pointed out, can and is a fucking nightmare. Terrible accessibility outside of big towns and cities, they keep buying those stupid coaches with several steps in them. They're not practical for our rural roads and they give nonsense about needing the space for luggage. They gave attempted to buy coaches with fucking stupid lifts for wheelchair users that are overly complicated for the driver and wastes everyone's time instead of a simple pull out ramp. \n\nCitylink do a much better job, but I still believe in public transport, we have to use it and I hope we see more of it and more ease of access for people to use it. \n\nIt's fucking embarrassing though that we have zero proper rail connection to Dublin airport, some shite private bus company (inaccessible in reality, some nonsense about a on board lift). Even Tallinn, a much smaller city, has a tram to the airport.",
        "I genuinely don't think we're unnuanced on this sub re public transport tbh but maybe we can be better",
        "Excuse me, can you do a little more research before you \"fact check\" because you're wrong on a lot of things here.\n\nFor a start, you need to look at the \u20ac1 options being offered by SNCF and just searched for a random route. Here is a list to get you started so you can inform yourself: https://www.ter.sncf.com/occitanie/tarifs-cartes/billets-un-euro\n\nAlso, Irish Rail doesn't offer a flat rate of \u20ac16, looking at the trains right now, the closest one is \u20ac18 which is still ridiculously expensive compared to the rest of Europe.\n\nRegarding the Student Leap Card, to apply online, you have to enter a university that is on its system. Unfortunately, this is impossible for non-Irish residents as it doesn't recognise universities outside of Ireland. It doesn't even recognise my university, which is Irish, and has changed its name recently. Plus you have to collect the card from an agent which is only available in big cities, which makes it impossible for international visitors. Again, Ireland is the only country in Europe that I'm aware of such ridiculous restrictions.\n\nIntercity is obviously going to run on better punctuality because of the short distance of journeys. Come back to me with figures on punctuality on rural transport and we'll talk.",
        "Public transport in Ireland.",
        "Ok, I\u2019ll be serious \ud83d\ude2c\n\nMost times I\u2019ve used the train, it\u2019s been slow, packed and late. Would be quicker to drive between Galway and Dublin than take the train. \n\nThe last bus eireann I took was 35 mins late for pickup (there was no explanation at the bus station and no indication about what time it was arriving) . Good job I wasn\u2019t under pressure to arrive in my destination at a specific time. \n\nDublin bus was hit and miss. Busses were dirty. To be expected in a city maybe but the last bus I was on looked like it had never been cleaned since it first went into service. \n\nThere was a general lack of integration between the different forms of public transport. Maybe this has improved since the Luas was introduced (I\u2019ve not had the pleasure yet). \n\nIrish public transport is very poor compared to other countries such as Sweden. I\u2019m sure there are many other European countries which we could look towards for top quality public transport services at a decent price.",
        "Great points- a clear consensus that rural and intercity buses are where we need to invest (if only we had a Green transport Minister!)\n\nHave family in East Galway and all of the local towns are no longer served by Bus Eireann where they used to be part of the Dublin to Galway route. It will indicate the satisfaction with the other local provider who remains that they are known locally as ShittyLink though personally I\u2019ve found them ok if very slow compared to trains.\n\nConsidering accessibility it\u2019s also unacceptable that wheelchair users travelling by train have to give 24 hours notice of travel for assistance and so many lifts are routinely out of order.",
        "Probably train to either Galway or Ennis (more likely the former) and then the Cliffs of Moher bus from Bus Eireann which runs between Galway and Ennis along the Clare coast",
        "Fair comments on the buses I think. On the train yes they definitely can be crowded (and I know the Galway train well). I think you\u2019re being a bit harsh about train punctuality. They do sometimes arrive late to intermediate stations but they generally seem to make it up by the time they reach the destination.\n That\u2019s broadly reflected in the punctuality stats from Irish Rail noted in the main post, with anything more than 10 mins reported as unpunctual. And driving time for the route per Google maps is equivalent at 2.5 hours to the train time.\n\nBut you\u2019re right in saying we need to learn from other countries and we\u2019re nowhere near the best countries like the Scandinavians",
        "I don\u2019t have personal experience of that route but unfortunately it can sometimes happen that a bus arrives at an intermediate stop and is already full. I don\u2019t know if it would help but on the assumption that most tourists using public transport travel from Dublin to Galway and Galway to the Cliffs/ Doolin, the bus route then continues to Ennis from the Cliffs so (I\u2019m theorising here now, don\u2019t know for sure if this is true) possibly the bus may be less busy going south from the Cliffs to Ennis. \n\nSo an option might be to get train (slightly less convenient than the Galway train) to Ennis and buck the trend by getting the bus North, and on your return head south to Ennis unfortunately you\u2019ll miss the Burren which is on the bus journey north from Doolin to Galway and very memorable scenery in my view.  Another possible option would be Dublin Galway (train) Doolin/Cliffs by bus, bus to Ennis and train back to Dublin from Ennis which at least avoids the risk that say the bus to Galway in Doolin has already filled up at the Cliffs. That route through Ennis would set you up well to head to Killarney or Cork if that was part of your itinerary.\n\nAs I say you\u2019d need to get someone with personal experience to confirm this. You could always ring Ennis or Galway Bus station for advice as well.",
        "Between major urban centres, it's fine. You'll normally have a bus, sometimes more than one competing operator and some places you'd also have the train. \n\nBut if you wanted to get further afield then it starts to get tricky. Rural Ireland relies heavily on taxis if the local buses don't go where you need, and those aren't especially cheap.\n\nWhen's the trip and what sort of places are on the list to go see?",
        "We split our time between Dublin and Galway and took just public transportation. Car rental and gas prices are so high that you could take a whole other vacation with that money! We took buses and trains the whole time. We took Gobus from Dublin to Galway and back. In Dublin, the DART will take you out to surrounding villages, and in Galway, the regional buses and train will do the same. It's totally doable, although the buses in Dublin were quite crowded.\nWe were quite pleased with the public transportation, since where we live in the US, there's pretty much nothing!\nOther areas, yes, you would need a car. We hoped for some scenic drives, but, we couldn't afford the car rental. We did take a day tour and saw we lot of beautiful countryside. We still had a great time and saw so much!

The Transport for Ireland and Bus Eireann sites will give you a good steer on timetables etc. \n\nIf you're looking to go off the beaten track a bit, renting a car is probably your best option.",

        "Walking can be hit and miss, depending on the location. A lot of the country roads can be narrow and windy with not a lot of space. On the other hand they can be quieter too, so you might not encounter many cars. Wearing a hi-viz jacket or band could be a good idea. \n\nTowns and villages should be fine, along with major tourist areas. There's also been some work to develop Greenways, walking and cycling routes through scenic areas, as well as some hiking routes, for example by the Cliffs of Moher.  I'm fairly certain there's an app or website that sets out different hiking routes but hopefully someone more knowledgeable than me will be along to advise!\n\nCycling the Ring of Kerry is fairly popular so you might find it easy enough to rent bikes when you're in Killarney.\n\nIreland is a relatively safe place. I don't think I've ever seen a hitchhiker to be honest so I'm not sure that it's very common. If you are doing this I'd suggest taking some safety precautions e.g. let someone on the farm know your plans. \n\nHave a ball whatever you end up doing!

Depending on what part of the burren you are going to, you'll probably get a bus to the farm from Ennis or from Galway.   \n\nHitchhiking is possible, especially for shorter journeys.

I took a carry on size suitcase on a few Dublin buses throughout the city and had zero trouble, and I imagine the airport bus would be the same, if not more accommodating. I looked up the Freedom Ticket and it\u2019s \u20ac45 for one adult, so probably \u20ac270 for your family. Single bus rides in Dublin are ~\u20ac2.60, so if we round up, that would mean needing to take 100 rides (or your whole family ride the bus 16 times) for the public transport aspect to be worth it. I stayed in an outer neighborhood of Dublin (Donnybrook) and was able to get the bus and be in town in 20 minutes. I would usually just take it in the morning to my first destination, walk everywhere during the day, and take it back at night. All the usual touristy spots in Dublin are pretty close together & walkable barring exigent circumstances, and if not they\u2019re just another \u20ac2.60 bus ride away. As for the Hop On-Hop Off bus part of the I have no experience, like I said things are pretty walkable, so the drawing aspect of this would have to be the tour guide aspect- could be fun! Like I said, I stayed further out from the city center, and had no problem getting a bus every day, so it would definitely be reasonable to look for accommodation out there, especially with the size of your family! I found the Google Maps public transport option very helpful in telling me how I could get where I wanted. Best of luck for your trip!",
        "That dodublin ticket includes buses to Dublin yes, but they're regular, stop at every stop for the people who live on the route buses and take an hour or more to get back to the city buses. With very limited luggage capacity. I've done both the 16 and Aircoach to and from the airport and I'll pick the Aircoach every time if I can possibly afford it. \n\nAnecdotally, you're late to booking for March in a reduced capacity situation to begin with. Looking along the Dart line is always a plan but no guarantee that you'll get cheaper.",
        "The hop-on/hop-off buses were amazing. Not only did we use them as transportation but each drive gave a bit of history/facts that were different then the other drivers. We ended up using them heavily in Dublin and Belfast.",
        "I would say car is your best bet. Where are you flying into? Driving around dublin can be daunting, and check out the parking availablity in the cities before you go in. Buses in Ireland are, in my opinion, awful. The trains are nice, but limit you hugely as you can't go everywhere.",
        "Buses will not be allowed down some of the narrow roads you're talking about because, well, they'd get STUCK.\n\nWhat you need are minivans. I know a group of Dutch people (they were 7) who got a minivan and were able to fit everyone and their bags in without any problems. However, they did agree to limit their luggage in advance to one suitcase per person, and stayed in a house with a washer/dryer. But two of those vehicles should sort ye. \n\nMight be an idea to hire a driver as well, and have one or two of your group drive the other vehicle.",
        "Ireland isn't all narrow roads.  We have plenty of motorways and wide roads too.  You will encounter some narrow ones in the more remote areas, but a lot of your travels will be on good roads.  For anything you might find challenging, just drive carefully.  You could hire a minibus to carry you all and give you some freedom, maybe two if necessary.  Ireland is only half the size of Wisconsin, so you can drive from Dublin on the east coast to Galway on the west coast  in less than 3 hours, in good traffic.  Clifden is a bit further on.  A night in Galway city is good and then do a day trip to Clifden and back.  Galway to Clifden isn't exactly high quality roads, but it is a scenic drive.  You can take your time and make plenty of stops along the way.\n\nYour arrival time in Dublin could be a factor in deciding what to do next, also the condition you are in after your flight.  So staying a night in Dublin could be a good idea.  The city is close to the airport and well served by buses.  It is only about 6 miles away.  So perhaps spend your first night in Dublin and head west after that.  Maybe pick up the rental vehicles on the day you leave Dublin.  Not much point in hiring one to drive just 6 miles and trying to navigate your way around a strange city, when public transport will get you to where you want to go.  Maybe revisit your itinerary and think about what way you want to go and how long to stay in Dublin.  \n\nMaybe Head to Galway first after Dublin, a night or two there taking in Clifden, and then head south towards Limerick, with a diversion off to see the famous Cliffs of Moher.  Past Limerick you will head further south to county Kerry, where Dingle is.  That area of the country is nice.  Your route could take you back towards Limerick and then it is motorway all the way to Dublin.  Alternatively you might head towards Cork and even on towards the southeast with Waterford and Wexford on your itinerary.  I don't know when you are coming or how long you are staying, but with a bit of planning, you could get a lot in.",

        "1. The weather will be variable. Bring layers that you can strip on and off. It can go from cold and windy to hot and humid quite quickly if you're outdoors. A light rainproof outer layer is mandatory.\n\n2. Public transportation overall isn't great, especially between rural areas. If, for example, you want to take public transport from Dublin to Glendalough, you might have trouble unless you go with a tour. And there's no connection between Glendalough and Galway at all. Public transportation in downtown Dublin will suit you just fine. My advice is to rent a car as soon as you leave Dublin!\n\n3. I can't speak too much for the night life. Pubs in Temple Bar are more popular with tourists and hen parties than locals. Pubs like O'Donoghue's and the rest in that area are more popular with locals. The young college crowd frequent the clubs along Harcourt and Camden street to the south. Don't get your expectations up to high though!\n\nIt's a decent itinerary, though most days will be busy. The only things I'd make note of are:\n\n- The spinc trail and miners village at Glendalough is easily a 6 hour hike for a person in moderate shape. Its roughly 10km roundtrip from the upper car park and 13km roundtrip from the lower car park. Unless you have the time, I would either hike to the top of the ridge by heading south from the upper lake, or I would just hike out to the miners village and back.\n- Taking a tour boat from Galway to the Aran islands saves you the time instead of driving to Doolin first. You will only have time to do one island, and I'd recommend Inishmore. Check to make sure the tours still run in October and book ahead!\n- Galway to Dublin to Bushmills is a long drive, but easy because it's all on the motorway. You might not have time to stop in the Mournes since they're a ways off the road. If you have time, you might be able to stop and see Slieve Gullion? It's a passage tomb at the top of a short hike if you park near the top.\n\nHave fun!",
        "My wife and I traveled all across Ireland a number of years ago, driving about 1000 miles over the course of 2 weeks. We ate all kinds of different food at all kinds of different B&Bs, pubs, and restaurants. We, of course had beef and lamb stew, but also some really delicious sandwiches, seafood, Full Irish Breakfasts, burgers, and small plates. We did not have any complaints about the flavor or quality of the food.  \n\nWe started in Dublin, drove through Glendalough, to Kilkenny, then through Cashel, to Cork. We made quick side trips to Cobh and Blarney from Cork, then drove on through Kinsale to Kenmare via the Wild Atlantic Way. Starting and finishing in Kenmare, we drove the Ring of Kerry and the Skellig Ring in a clockwise direction, opposite the way that any tour buses are required to drive. Next, we stopped at Bunratty Castle and the Cliffs of Moher before staying over in Doolin. From there we drove through the Burren and Kinvara to get to Galway where we spent a couple nights just down the street from the rugby stadium. We did a whiskey tour, went to Galway Crystal, and did the Long Walk. From Galway, we went to the village of Cong where we stayed a night at Ashford Castle. While at the castle, we explored the grounds, had a glorious high-tea, and took a guided hawk walk through the Ireland School of Falconry. From Cong, we went back to Dublin via Headford to see Ross Errilly Friary. We flew out of Dublin, back to the U.S. the next afternoon.",
        "You think Irish public transport is good? Jesus. It must be *awful-to-non-existent* in the US then.",
        "1) Yes. Apply common sense like you would in any city.\n\n2) Public transport in Ireland is not great. Having said that, from Dublin you would be able to take a number of different day trips. Galway and Belfast would be two examples easily within reach. If I were you I'd go on an organised tour bus though, take the hassle out of it\n\n3) Belfast and Dublin will tick the history boxes. Plenty of beautiful sights all over Ireland if you're into nature and photography, but seeing as you mentioned Galway already, that's where I'd recommend. Although most of the beauty is found an hour or more outside the city\n\n4) As above?\n\n5) Irish weather is not predictable. Late October is PROBABLY a bit too early for snow but you could get some very cold and wet weather if you're unlucky (maybe 3-4C). If you're lucky, the weather could be dry and in the mid to high teens. And if everything is normal, you're probably looking at high single digits or low double digits. If very cold weather is a deal breaker then do NOT come in October! May-June are statistically the driest months and temperatures should be in double digits on a daily basis",

It's not particularly unsafe here: the problem is that anti-social behaviour gets reported often, the **social** behaviour does not. Keep your wits about you and you'll be fine.

        "Hotels can be expensive in galway but just make sure you get the city centre unless you have a car, public transport and traffic can be a nightmare! I live in galway.",
        "Driving on the left might seem daunting but if they are experienced / confident drivers they will soon have the hang of it. \n\nIf they won\u2019t be driving I think you need to drop the idea of the Skelligs - they could get a coach or train from Dublin to a hub like Galway, Killarney or Cork, and book day drips or hire a car there to see some sights, but being dependent on public transport to get out to somewhere like Portmagee, makes the logistics too difficult imo at least in the context of a short trip.",
        "Unfortunately, there\u2019s a short answer here. It can\u2019t be done using public transport.",
        "It is doable, by public transport or driving. It won't take them that long to adapt to driving. They will be in a car for driving that way. People think it is a bigger deal than it is. So certainly do not rule out the car. There are better reasons for ruling it out than the side of the road you are on. You can relax and enjoy your journey if someone else is driving. You do not have to worry about things like navigation.",
        "I have been on Skellig the route up to the beehive huts is steps with a fall off on one side it is ok on the way up but on the way down it is steps down and a fall off on your right. I don't know if they have put a railing up or not so bring walking poles for the decent.",
        "Book it now.\n\nGoogle search skellig landing tour; several companies run boats. All well rated so I\u2019m not sure which one stands out more than another. We\u2019re actually going 5/21 with  Sea Quest ([Skellig Rock Cruises](https://www.skelligsrock.com)) since they were the company that took out the cast and crew from Star Wars.\n\nBut public transport isn\u2019t handy to Portmagee. And you need to be there by 8 am the morning of if it departs on time. It\u2019s an hour and a half to get there according to Google and most people recommend that you add 20% to that so at least 1 hr 40 minutes. Most public transport won\u2019t run that early so my recommendation is get to Portmagee the day before in their case (even if they get their own car too, especially if they\u2019re not early morning people)\n\nIf it does get cancelled the morning of, the tour company may still do the eco tour (just boat around the island). But there is also lots to do in that area too; check out one of my recent posts here. A lot of people gave great suggestions on it for alternatives to skellig if it gets cancelled",
        "Just did a week roadtrip hitting all the same spots!\n\nWe found that car hire was super affordable and well worth it. I didn't look into public transport between the areas but I feel like you will have a better experience for off the beaten path activities if you can drive.\n\nFor example you can stop on the way from Dublin to Cork at the Rock of Cashel or Kilkenny and there are a lot of super easy day trips from Cork (30 mins to 1 hour one way) that might be difficult without a car. We did Cobh and Kinsale but there is also a distillery in Midleton.\n\nBetween Cork and Dingle I'd recommend Killarney. It was raining when passed through but Muckross Abbey and House might be interesting as a group.\n\nLooks like you will have a bit of time in Dublin which is totally fine because there is lots to do but if you're looking for an outdoorsy day coast walk from Greystones to Bray was great. Train from Dublin of course.\n\nSlea Head Drive in Dingle is also a must!",
        "Dublin, I'd do the Guinness storehouse and that's all. Don't buy your souvenirs there as they are cheap and can be bought in any gift store or online. With taking public transport it's very unreliable and if you call a smaller bus operator they would likely price out doing the full tour for you and the experience would be much better and most of the time comes with stories and local knowledge. PM me and I'll recommend some companies that I would hire or at least price. You could do the ring of Kerry if you got a minibus too",
        "Train from Cork City gets you to Midleton and the Jameson distillery. Cobh train will get you to Titanic experience. A lot of Buses connect to Blarney,  Kinsale and West Cork. Enjoy",
        "This isn\u2019t my experience at all. Trains are a lovely way to travel and highly reliable.\n\nYou can view stats for individual train routes here https://www.irishrail.ie/en-ie/about-us/train-punctuality-reliability-performance and most train routes offer opportunities to see scenic views though generally the Midlands (which you can\u2019t avoid en route from Dublin to the West or South coast) are a bit less interesting. It\u2019s also a nice way to chat to locals who are fellow travellers.\n\nSome local rural buses can be a little hit and miss in places but the intercity routes tend to be mostly ok in my experience.\n\nI mean I wouldn\u2019t tack a time sensitive international flight onto the end of them but worst case you\u2019re normally only delayed by 20 mins or so which probably isn\u2019t going to ruin your holiday. \n\nTo get from Dingle to Galway is a bit messy to be honest using public transport. Better off visiting Dingle by bus on a different day and then leaving from Killarney instead (Killarney is served by train from Dublin) and getting the train from Killarney to Ennis. The Cliffs of Moher bus with Bus Eireann goes from Ennis to Galway via a very scenic route thru the Burren and stops at Cliffs, Doolin etc.\n\nShout if you have any other questions.",
        "Hello. Go to Dingle Co Kerry for an excellent New Year experience. It has featured on the top ten places to be worldwide on New Year\u2019s Day and will provide you with an experience that represents authentic Ireland more than getting pissed in a sweat box in Dublin and feeling like a drunk sardine stuck in a tin of drunk sardines. You don\u2019t need to know Irish at all as, sadly, it\u2019s a dead language spoken only in pockets of Ireland. Dingle is one if says pockets but even among the locals few of them actually speak Irish. Cillian Murphy (Oppenheimer) and Aiden Gillen (Littlefinger from Gane of Thrones) regularly holiday down there. There is rugged country and great traditional music. Food options are also extremely good and varied down there. Dublin is fine for a short stay but it\u2019s expensive in terms of accommodation and the homeless issue is really a blight on the city at this point. You can fly to Kerry airport and get a bus from there. There are several good options for accommodation in Dingle and there are great options for things to do both on land and at sea. Hellboy 2: The Golden Army and the recent Star Wars films were filmed down there and since they\u2019re heavily dependent on tourism they\u2019re generally only too happy to welcome tourists. Public transport is good and cheap although times can be limited depending on days and the services are a bit more irregular than in other European countries. On New Years people congregate on the bridge for the countdown and right next to the bridge is the pub where everyone fills into late at night. The droichead beag. Literally means little bridge. Also Dick Macks (across from the church) and Foxy Johns are good bets for a drink earlier in the day. People are friendly there and the locals will likely see you as exotic. You\u2019ll be totally fine, have good fun, eat and drink we\u2019ll and hopefully get lucky for yourself.",
        "Jesus no, honestly really not worth it. Go somewhere warm, drink cocktails, stock up on vitamin D and warm the bones.

If so, do you recommend any rental services over others and what would be the price range per day?\n\n\nPublic transport is shite in the cities and practically non existent outside of cities \n\n\n> that are not full of tourists\n\n\nLiterally not going to happen, it's the holiday season and you're not the only one thinking of a short break, considering Ireland is now the only English speaking country in Europe its lead to a huge influx of not only tourist but people moving here.\n\n\n, I'd rather meet friendly local people, if they are friendly? Do people rather dislike tourists and foreigners or are they happy to meet some, if they dont behave like total cumstains? Any areas that are cool to see, any museums, theatres, places you recommend? I'm very interested in history, classic art and culture.\n\n\nFriendly and civil but don't expect to make friends. Lots of museums same as every other capital city. \n\n\n>Will there be a lot of action during the holidays, or is everyone with their families and shops, pubs, etc. are mostly closed? And any recommendation for a friendly pub where a lonesome foreigner can spend New Years Eve without being looked at like a weird figure? Any places you recommend to meet some cool people to hang out for a few days, while I'd be in Dublin?\n\n\nAction? It's holiday season it'll be busy with revellers and tourists. Pubs will be jammers on new years eve the same as any other pub the world over. As I've said everyone will be civil and polite I don't know what else you're expecting? Life long friends, no , not even those who moved here can manage that. \n\n\n>Any (cheap) places to stay you can recommend? I dont need much, but I'd prefer my own room with my own bed over a six bed hostel room, I'm not exactly a backpacker.\n\n\nNo cheap accommodation in Ireland if you haven't booked anywhere by now, I'd get cracking, accommodation is scarce and expensive, that's just how it is. Booking.com will show you that\n\n\n>For the week after New Years I'd love to travel the countryside, see some cool nature, stay in some relaxed villages, with some friendly locals, a few sheep, an inn or an pub, especially if they might have a room to rent, so I can stay each night somewhere else and walk around in the nature a bit. Idk, any must sees or anyone from a superb village they can recommend to stay awhile and enjoy some traditional irish food? I dont need parties or anything special, just some calm and relaxation is what i need. Eat, drink, sleep, read, write, walk around, you get the gist? Smth smth pittoresque. Whats your must-sees?\n\nIt really depends on where in the country you want to go, at this time of year sunset is 4.30pm and with the rain, fog, possible snow or sleet you'll really not see much. I honestly can't be more positive, it's shite here at the best of times but winter is long, freezing, bleak and depressing.",
        "Cork, Kerry or Galway is where you want to go if you are looking for a proper Irish experience. Avoid Dublin. Anyone not from Dublin will tell you that as in general we avoid Dublin too! \nThe weather will be bad, but you sound prepared for it. If you are wanting to go to small villages you are best to rent a car for a few days, like some people have already said unless you are in a city the public transport is sparse. With cork and Kerry you'll get the wild Atlantic way and even though the weather isn't great it is actually really nice this time of year. Hope that helps with your plans.",

        "As a Clare person who has never been to the Cliffs, I would say that you have a very short amount of time in Ireland and there are better things to do and see while you are here. If you rely on public transport you will find it very limiting trying to get a bus to the places in Clare that you mention. If you really wanted to see them I think you should take a look at the tourist buses like Paddywagon. They tend to do the main tourist things in one trip. \n\nArriving at Dublin airport you will either have to take a bus or taxi to the city centre. The bus could take an hour. You'll then have to take a train to Galway or Limerick, that's another couple of hours, possibly a minimum 1 hour wait for the train. Then in Limerick you will have to get a bus to Ennis to catch a connecting bus to the Cliffs or Doolin. It will take you a minimum of 45 minutes to get to Ennis. I don't know how long it takes from Ennis to the Cliffs/Doolin.  You would spend a lot of time traveling.",

Doolin is an awesome place to overnight one of the prime\nlocations to hear authentic Irish traditional music in local pubs) so pick up the bus (or pre arrange a cab) to pick you up in the Cliffs visitor centre back to Doolin then next morning reverse the journey back to Galway and Dublin. An added bonus is that bus route also brings you through the Burren. So are the Cliffs worth 1.5 days of your time out of a 3 day visit, I\u2019d say probably not but if you see the Burren and spend a night in Doolin it makes a little more sense and gives more value.\n\nInfo on the cliff walk here https://www.cliffsofmoher.ie/your-visit/beyond-the-cliffs-places-to-see/cliffs-of-moher-coastal-walk/\n\nThe problem with tour buses is they only go to and from the visitor centre which can be very crowded and it\u2019s not the optimal viewing position for the them. \n\nYou should be ok with booking trains a few days before hand at www.irishrail.ie however that particular bus might be a bit busier (others may have more specific knowledge here) but I definitely wouldn\u2019t leave it to the last minute.\n\nCliffs bus timetable is here https://www.buseireann.ie/inner.php?id=406&form-view-timetables-from=Galway+%28Bus+Station%29&form-view-timetables-to=Cliffs+of+Moher+%28Coach+Park%29&form-view-timetables-route=&form-view-timetables-submit=1\n\nAnd the Galway to Dublin train is here.\n\nhttps://www.irishrail.ie/en-ie/accordion/pdf-timetables/dublin-heuston-galway\n\nPublic transport in Ireland is cheap, comfortable (especially the trains) and a super way to travel\u2026 trains generally fast but buses a little slower and anyway Doolin/Cliffs are only served by buses.\n\nHope that helps and shout if you need more advice.",

Stick to Dublin or in such a short stay you'll end up wrecked and won't enjoy it.",
        "Try to book your accommodation for the night of the Taylor Swift concert as soon as possible. Unfortunately hotel prices skyrocket whenever there is a gig on you may find it tough to get decent prices there. It may be worthwhile looking at a hotel further out where you can get public transport to the gig. B&B's may be slightly cheaper but not all are online so you might need to ring a few to find availability. \n\nWith 7 days, you have plenty of time to see areas other than Dublin. While public transport isn't as great as other parts of Europe, you will be able to get to larger towns and cities via bus or train. Transport for Ireland is a good website to check out how to get to different destinations. \n\nAs for where to go, you'll find tons of suggestions in this sub, but an idea of what you're interested in doing will help narrow down suggestions. It's absolutely possible to fly to another country in the 7 days you have. Ryanair is a low cost airline that serves a lot of Europe. Just beware that it could mean spending a lot of your holiday in airports so unless you have a burning desire to see another country, there will be plenty to entertain you here!",
        "Spend most of your trip outside of dublin every single tourist I ask prefers the likes of Galway/kerry to dublin. Citylink will bring you right to dublin airport from Galway/cork/limerick also bus eireann or Irish rail for transport. Green bus should bring you from dublin to kerry either. Best to go back through old posts for suggestions on what to do.",
        "You could use public transport to travel around Ireland and save a lot of money. It does of course depend on where you are travelling, but you certainly won't need a car for all of the time. Work out some idea of where you want to go and then look at the transport options.",
        "Dublin is a compact and relatively flat city, so it is easy to walk around. There is a reasonably good bus service. We also have a light rail system, though it only has two lines. There is a rail line along the coast, known as the DART. Which is best depends on where you want to go.",

        "Welcome! You\u2019re going to have a great time! Galway and Limerick are great, as well as accommodation in AirBNBs if that is the route you want to go.\n\nThere are a couple things you should know:\n\n- if you are under 25, so you will have a hard time renting cars in Ireland- most rental places require you to be at least 25. \n\n- you\u2019re going to pay a premium if you do find a place to rent to you, and a premium for automatics. So be prepared for this. It could easily increase the cost of your rental by 50% or even double it.\n\n- I personally recommend Costco for the rental. They require you to be 25, but there are no hidden charges. You can also try Eurocar.\n\n- get the smallest car you can manage to fit your luggage in. DONT get an SUV. Roads can be narrow in Ireland, and even in the city, with cars parked on each side, it\u2019s though to navigate. Lots of lost mirrors and damaged quarter panels. \n\n- the cost of additional insurance can double the cost of your rental. Best to arrange insurance outside of your rental company, but make sure they accept it. We use the credit card insurance- BUT CALL the CC  implant and get a letter ensuring you are specifically covers for Ireland. Ask them about what\u2019s covered.\n\n- note if you manage to do the above, companies like Budget or Hertz or Enterprise can take a CRAZY deposit since you aren\u2019t using their insurance.my largest deposit was \u20ac5,000! (The refunded it at car return, but (!))\n\n- THE ABOVE being said, it may be better for you to skip the rental and take busses, trains and public transport around Ireland. Perfectly doable, but takes time.\n\n- use Google Maps or Rome2Rio to route plan.\n\n- I take the train from Galway to Dublin and back 2X a week. It\u2019s fine. You can take busses to most places for like \u20ac15 if you want to go to other cities. I prefer trains for the view though.\n\n- DONT RENT A CAR IN DUBLIN. It\u2019s a waste. Traffic sucks. Walk, bus or bike. Seriously.",
        "No, it is definitely not really doable if you do not have a car, if you have a car it is possible, though not recommended, you would end up travelling all day. \n\nYou could plan another base in Killarney, even if on public transport eg go by bus from Galway to Killarney and then train back direct to Dublin. You would need to start early in am eg 9.00am  latest, out of Galway to avoid spending all day travelling. \n\nSpending most of your week travelling from a to b,  is a poor use of your time, when you would have much better time seeing a smaller number of areas.",
        "Is your issue you're not old enough to rent a car? If this is the case, you can try using the public transport system: [www.transportforIreland.ie](https://www.transportforIreland.ie), or you could join PaddyWagon tours or similar to get to places.",
        "The DART train line and buses are your best bet for getting around. \ud83d\ude85",
        "It takes about 2.5 hours, with the bus being slightly nearer to 3. Pre book your tickets online for the best price more than an hour before. At the station is more $$.\n\nThere\u2019s Wi-Fi, but no food services currently on board.  Bring food  or snacks for the journey. Pre-book and choose your seats together at a table.\n\nThe train is fine. Several trains each direction leaving almost every 1.5-2 hours. Cost 1-way is between \u20ac11-15. You may be able to get a student rate, but you have to check as the verification/requirements for student have changed. Recommend getting a \u201cLeap\u201d card which you can purchase at the train station kiosks for busses for around the city as well.\n\n\nBut, note that you may prefer a bus (such as Eir Eagle or GoBuS) if you are cling straight from the Airport to Galway. As this is quickest way to get on the road and out of the city- as the buses to Galway are usually direct.  They\u2019re nice, but not my preferred method unless I have an odd schedule or just need to get there.\n\nIf i remember  correctly, there is a not a good bus to get from Dublin Airport to Heuston station where the train is. \n\nBut, if you plan to run around Dublin City first, no worries then take a bus into town (40 minutes) and then run around town. Get the train when you are headed out to Galway.",

        "The general city scape in Dublin isn't great for accessibility. Expect lots of narrow pavements and in places there are uneven surfaces. In general most pedestrian crossings have dropped curbs.\n\nModern buildings have decent accessibility but a lot of our most popular museums and attractions are based out of older buildings that wouldn't be quite as accessible.\n\nPublic transport isn't the worst. Most forms of public transport can be boarded in a wheelchair. On busses may need to ask the driver for assistance and on the train line you can ask staff at the station for assistance and they will call ahead to your destination station to give notice. Certain stations are notorious for having permanently out of order lifts so you may need to help her up and down the station stairs at times.\n\nThe percentage of the taxi fleet set up for wheelchairs is low enough, so you will generally have to book in advance to secure wheelchair accessible taxi. Private hire doesn't really exist here, so Uber is just a  booking app for standard taxis. Freenow is more widely used for taxi booking than Uber.",
        "The tram service is step free so she can roll right on, buses should have ramps. Trains are accessible but you need to book a ramp 24 hours in advance",
        "If you can afford a private tour company I'd go that way. And they will plan stuff around everyone's needs.\n\nDoing Ireland via public transport with limited mobility would be a test of persistence, patience, frustration, and strangely enjoyable.",
        "A mobility scooter absolutely kills most of your access to any sorts of public transport long distance unless it's one of the folding ones. Any way you's could do push wheelchair? Could she get up coach bus steps or is that a no go?",
        "I think you should be find if she's able to stand up and walk a few steps. Def be much handier for buses and trains as our trains don't have ramps so you've to wait for them to bring a ramp and only 1 wheelchair can fit on a bus so if she can walk to a seat and fold the chair you'll def have more options.",
        "Just for clarity: Mobility scooter is a no go because...\n\nCoaches - if you can find one that's accessible, may only be able to take one wheelchair, and it way not included a scooter which is bigger than a fully motorised chair.\n\nOh, and in case it's relevant. Coach buses here tend not to have the toilets open, at all. So that might need to be considered.\n\nLocal Buses - would probably be the least issue but only one WC space per bus and if in use already, you have to wait for next one, in whatever weather.\n\nTaxi's - getting a full size taxi with ramps etc to get a motorised WC in and out takes lots of planning and booking ahead, there really aren't many in the whole city, and again, not sure they can actually take a scooter (probably can). And, they don't have much room for other people, so every trip would be 2 taxis every time.\n\nTrains - The trains themselves aren't the problem here, it's the stations... and this will apply even if she can walk a bit. Specifically it's if the ramps are needed getting on and off trains, that requires enquiring ahead of time and then, the lifts. So many stations consistently have the accessibility lifts out of order meaning you've to somehow get her and WC or Scooter up and down a large set of steps, either inbound or outbound (or, both). It's a gamble as to whether you can get out of a station if you've been able to get off the train in the first place. (I follow a couple of WC using people on twitter and this is by far the biggest issue in public transport here).\n\nAs the other user has mentioned the narrower paths with uneven surface, that's very relevant for urban areas. Strides are constantly being made for tourist attractions but some places there is only so much that can be done. Websites should detail the accessibility there is or isn't, so a bit of research will go a long way. \n\nI was about to say just rent a car but tbh, a folding WC takes up so much room in a boot, you'd need an estate just to be able to fit luggage as well. \n\nIt can of course be done, it'll just takes some thinking about",

If you are planning to head back over near Leinster at all I would recommend Meath. They have places like newgrange (ancient burial tomb that predates the pyramids) and the hill of Tara, they also have Trim castle which I personally love. Lots of great history in the Meath area! Glendalough is located in the Wicklow mountains and is also super stunning you can hike or go more relaxed trails and the views are out of this world. \n\nCongratulations on being cancer free also!",

        "No, that would be incredibly taxing to constantly have to drive back to Dublin every day. In that case you'd be better off renting the car anyway and actually moving around. And to fill your 2 weeks with guided tours from Dublin would be very expensive.\n\nWhat do you want to get out of a trip to Ireland? It can be done with just public transport and taxis if you plan things but it's not as free as having a car",
        "A car in Dublin would be a pain. Dublin is walkable and has lots taxi and buses. \nFor out of town, trains or buses connect to most towns. Getting to some of the more of the beaten track locations, are a bit harder to get to. Small group tours are a pretty good option. I took one through Powerscourt, Wicklow Mountains and Glendalough. \nIf you do want get a car, look into day rentals. Especially with a pick up on the edge of town. \nThe driving was pretty easy to adjust to, the most challenging part for me was in small towns and villages. The narrow streets and pedestrians just walking out in front of you meant that you had to be alert, constantly. \nDublin was fun, but I would recommend staying in other places. Some of the excursions, whether you drive yourself or book tours, make for long days in a vehicle. \nAs compact as Ireland is, you spend a lot more time in transit than you would realize.",
        "Once you're outside of the towns and cities, it's just narrower country roads, and for the most part they are actually easier to drive on - I find. But then again, I get a bit testy if I have to stop and start a lot for traffic lights. \n\nIt's honestly not that hard to switch from one side to the other, especially if you're driving an automatic car - which you should book as soon as possible as they are NOT the default here. \n\nI don't know what you mean by 'the island is drivable in half a day' but I suspect you might have been misinformed. Aside from the few stretches of motorway, roads in Ireland are NOT built for large volumes of high-speed traffic, you will NOT be driving 100 miles in 100 minutes on them. In addition to other cars, you will very likely come across coaches, trucks, caravans, campervans, tractors, farm machinery like combine harvesters and trailers, construction machinery, cyclists, walkers, even farm animals like cattle, sheep and horses. \n\nAll over Ireland are towns and villages, and quite honestly, THESE are the beating heart of the country. All of them have tourist accommodation of some sort either in the towns themselves, or close by - hostels, Bed & Breakfasts, hotels, Farmhouse Stays, campsites, caravan parks. All you have to do is pick a town - say Lisdoonvarna in County Clare, and simply Google Lisdoonvarna+hotel or Lisdoonvarna+accommodation, and something will come up. WAY BETTER to leave Dublin and drive to these places and stay there. In summer especially there'll be plenty to see and do and enough places to eat. \n\nWe do have a public transportation system as well - buses mainly for rural areas in the west - and this can be accessed via [www.transportforireland.ie](https://www.transportforireland.ie). As July is the high season in tourism, there will be more services on then. \n\nStaying in Dublin and driving out every day is, frankly, insane. Not to mention expensive and exhausting. Pick up your rental car when you leave, bring it back when you arrive in Dublin, don't bother with it in the city, it's more a liability than a help there.",
        "Agreed, parking and traffic are no fun in Dublin City. I live here and even though I have a car and work in the city centre, I choose to cycle in and most other Dubliners moving around the city centre choose methods other than driving (train, bus, tram, bike, walk). A colleague was telling me it took him 90 mins to complete a 5km journey yesterday.",
        "Good advice. \n\nDriving back to Dublin each day would be insane.\nWhat I don\u2019t think anyone has mentioned is that driving from Dublin to Cork, Belfast, Galway you\u2019ll be on motorways so you don\u2019t really feel that you\u2019re on the wrong side of the road as much.\n\nYou can cover a lot of ground to get between the main cities in a few hours but all the good stuff (Kerry, West Cork, Clare, North Antrim (Giants)) is an hour or two past where the motorway ends. So Dublin say Dingle is probably a 10 hour round trip.\n\nDo consider Public trains and buses and a few well chosen local day tours- trains in particular are fast, cheap and really comfortable",
        "Rathcroghan is unreachable by public transport, especially coming from Dublin. Your best bet is the train to Roscommon and a taxi up to Rathcroghan. Shillelagh you should be able to do this by taking the train to Carlow and then the bus heading towards Arklow stops along the way at Shillelagh.\n\nThe Giant's Causeway and Cliffs of Moher are way too far away from Dublin for the day, you'll spend most of your time stuck on a bus, but if they're a must for you and you don't mind the bus, go for it. \n\nIf you want to get out of Dublin City Centre, but still stay close by, maybe try the Dublin Coastal Trail, very reachable by bus or train. D\u00fan Laoghaire's seafront is beaut!",
        "I've never looked into the Citypass, so not sure what it includes, but a lot of the Dublin museums are free, so have a look at which ones you actually plan to go to and see if it's worth your while. \n\nIf you're splitting your time with another location (and with 5 days, it's absolutely doable), it might be easier and cheaper to just pay your own way on the things you do in Dublin. \n\nLook into a tourist Leap Card if you'll need to use public transport",
        "The very first activity you should do is a bus tour of the city. That will give you a good overview of the city and ideas for things to do while you are here. If you have done your research, then a lot should be familiar. Dublin is compact and relatively flat, so it is easy to walk around.\n\nDay trips could include Glendalough, Newgrange and trips on the DART rail service, north towards Howth and south towards Bray. If you want to get away from Dublin for some of your visit, head to Galway and do tours to Connemara and the Cliffs of Moher. After a trans-Atlantic flight, you might be tired. While you could get a bus to Galway direct from the Airport, it might be better to stay in Dublin and travel to Galway another day.

        "Just on the gallery bit: in Dublin you\u2019ve three (no! Four. See addendum) real gems you mustn\u2019t miss. All free entry. \n\nFirst, the National Gallery is an utter treasure box. A really charming building, with a collection that\u2019s small by international standards but which includes many *perfect* paintings that will lift your heart. (I think our Vermeer is one of the artist\u2019s greatest works, for instance, and our Caravaggio has a thrilling history in  Ireland) \nAcross the city there\u2019s Dublin City Gallery, known to us as the Hugh Lane Gallery, which takes up the baton of art history where the National Gallery\u2019s collection ends, and moves into the 20th century. Some items and installations there that are essential viewing. (There\u2019s also a first class restaurant, if you fancy an excellent supper.) \n\nOut a small distance to Heuston railway station there\u2019s IMMA: the Irish Museum of Modern Art at the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham. Housed adjacent to Kilmainham Gaol as the gallery is, you\u2019ll be on intensely hallowed ground connected with the Easter Rising. \n(Edited to disentangle my information)\n\n\nThese three galleries are the state\u2019s principal galleries, but of course Dublin also has umpteen independent galleries dotted throughout the city. Strolling around the city you\u2019ll see many public sculptures, most of which will have been traditionally rechristened  by some local wit. Buildings too: I could meander around Dublin for days just ogling the architecture. \n\n(Edit: I forgot to mention the Chester Beatty Library, which holds a collection of Eastern art and also crafts. A heavenly place and a gorgeous collection.)\n\nElsewhere in Ireland you\u2019ll find more excellent public galleries, some meriting a visit even just for the architecture. Churches too are worth considering, if you\u2019re an admirer of stained glass, especially. Much depends on your itinerary, of course. (For example in West Cork you\u2019d have to investigate James Turrell\u2019s stupendous Sky Garden)",

        "Rent a car the public transport is so bad you will be stranded",
        "Yes on car, it wil make Ur holiday. You do not need a car in Dublin. \n\nBest way to see cliffs is walk trail from Doolin, assuming weather ok, it takes 90 mins 1 way, free  parking at o' Connors pub. You can also travel up and back by shuttle bus.",
        "Sorry lol. We live in America. There are some horror stories about public transportation here.",
        "People use pepper spray in enclosed public transport?? Hmm what could go wrong\u2026. We don\u2019t have those issues here- not saying public transport is utopia but the very idea of thinking you would need pepper spray to protect yourself is baffling. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f enjoy your stay",
        "Do you mean horror stories about public transportation in Ireland or America?",
        "Hmm. I\u2019ll have to think about the deposit part of the equation. \n\nOn a side note is public transport that much of a hassle? We\u2019ll be carrying some suitcases and also walk a little with them until we get to our Airbnb but would having a car would add a lot to the experience at Moher?",
        "Public transport is good getting around Dublin. Also remember that busses from the Airport go to major cities for pretty reasonable prices- like AirCoach or GoBus.\n\n\n\nOr you could take a Bus to Galway. I take the train from Galway to Dublin weekly- its about $30 round trip. The bus is less, but takes longer, and is less scenic.\n\nDriving gets you the fun option of going to the sites on the way to Doolin. You can see the Burren, Caves and other neat shops along the way. You can go at your own pace. AND if you have time, you can go to the Aran Islands from Dolan.\n\nWord of advice though, I don\u2019t think the Cliff Tours by boat are worth it. Better to see if from the top of the cliffs by running them than by sea. The boat doesn\u2019t get close enough anyway. The Clifs visitors center is kinda lame as well. There some interactive things for kids, but the movie they show there is uninformative.\n\nGo to the Aran islands and rent a bike there for $10 with your family. It\u2019s 100% with it if the weather isn\u2019t bad. Pre-book tickets.\n\nBUT, for you going to Doolin, really the car is yor best option. I guess one other thing you could do is use \u201cGo Car\u201d- but you have to pre-register for it for them to take your license info. Then you rent the car by the hour. Insurance is included, but the kicker is I think it has to be returned the spot you rented it from. GoCar.ie if you want to check.\n\n\nBUT, regular city busses don\u2019t take credit card. You have to bring exact cash. OR buy a LEAP card from one of the retailers or bus hubs. Check Leapcard.ie for more info.\n\nLiving in Galway, relying on busses is cheap, but the trade off is it takes forever to get someplace. The time saving may be worth just taking a taxi for small trips.",
        "You could do a lot of these trip by public transport or organised tours, but you could save yourself a lot of hassles by renting a car",
        "Hi there and thank you so much for your tips! \n\nFor the trains, I heard buying tickets online in advance is the cheapest way to do so. Let me know if I'm right :)\n\nI hadn't heard too much of the Connemara region so I'm definitely excited to do some research on it and possibly add it into our mix! Do you have any specific recommendations you definitely recommend - either castle ruins, or scenic areas, nice towns, etc.\n\nI was doing some research on Doolin recently and found that the trail between Doolin and Cliffs of Moher was currently closed due to safety concerns. Do you still think Doolin is a good bet for this?\n\nIn the Dingle peninsula region, I'm not too familiar with it yet - Would you have any recommendations on what to visit and/or whether it is worth grabbing some sort of tour? I assume you mean staying in Dingle for the period of time.\n\nThanks for the tip on Tralee! Would this allow us to also check out Ring of Kerry somehow? I know we won't have a car but I'm wondering what options may allow us to see the top highlights of the ring (I saw some tours offered for it). Also, other than Ring of Kerry and Killarney National Park, are there any other major items of note that you recommend? Also, what are the best websites for booking B&Bs in Ireland?\n\nAlso, if we were to take away a tiny bit of time from the other stops to try a visit to Cork, would that be a fun place to visit? Ive heard wonderful things so I was hoping to stop by on my way back to Dublin.\n\n  \nSorry for all the questions and thanks so much for the help!!",
        "I live and work in Doolin.  \nThe trail from Doolin along the Cliffs of Moher is not closed.",
        ">there are buses that go from Tralee to Killarney). The reason I don't recommend staying in Killarney is because it is one of the biggest tourist hotspots in the country, which means it is also incredibly expensive to stay there. Tralee will cost a fraction of what you would be paying to stay in Killarney. You can also take the train \n\nJust rent a car from Dublin and return to Dublin at the end - it will make logistics so much easier and rental car prices are cheap right now compared to a year ago. It took me the drive from the airport rental car parking lot to the main road to get used to driving on the left; it's really not that bad and you should give yourself more credit!",
        "I really wouldn\u2019t bike in Dublin with a kid our cycle lanes literally are in the bus lane they\u2019re not safe, there are some areas with nice designated cycle paths such as along the coast from Fairview to Sutton and some other greenways dotted around but really it\u2019s not a cyclist friendly city especially with kids, if you wanted you could do a day of cycling and do the route I mentioned along the coast and stop into St Anne\u2019s park which is really nice and has a good playground, if you go on a Saturday they have food stalls and you could easily spend a few hours there, then you could cycle over to the beach along the causeway",
        "The street bike rental schemes don't have bikes with child seats not helmets, so you'd have to find a shop that hires out, but tbh, unless you knew Dublin well I'd not be trying to bike with a kid in the city centre. The bike lanes aren't everywhere and they aren't segregated hardly at all. Dublin is very walkable, a stroller for kid and you'd be safer",
        "Ashtown Castle in the Phoenix Park has a good playground as well as a cafe and lots of space to run around with a toddler. If you want to do some cycling in a safer environment, the park also has lots of cycle paths that are separated from the main car traffic. There's a place to rent bikes at the main entrance to the park. Dublin Zoo is also in the park and well worth a visit. \n\nMore centrally, Stephens Green and Merion Square parks also both have playgrounds too. \n\nNot free, but if you have a car, Airfield estate near Dundrum is a great spot for kids with farm animals and playground bits. Slightly further afield but good for kids, have a look at Newgrange farm in Meath and Avondale forest park in Wicklow (the beyond the trees treetop walk has a giant slide and is really cool, plus there's a nice playground by the cafe at the house and lovely woodland walking trails). \n\nBray seafront is also a nice place for a day trip with little ones. There's a playground there as well. \n\nNot far from Derry, Wild Ireland might be of interest.",
        "The nicest playgrounds in Galway are behind the Cathedral, on the Claddagh and near the aquarium in Salthill. There are also large beaches to run around on if the tide is out. I don\u2019t know anything about bike rental with toddler seats but narrow roads, few cycle lanes and busy traffic combined with wind and rain make it a tough city for cyclists. Personally I wouldn\u2019t expose my toddler to that but some brave people do.",
        "A lot of negative nellys here on the cycling. If you are planning on living in the Dublin suburbs there are loads of lovely cycling routes and gorgeous parks. I don\u2019t know much about hiring bike seats but you could try www.thebikehub.ie they are super enthusiastic about getting people out on bikes and they are situated on a really nice coast bike path in Dun Laoghaire. If you are right in Dublin City centre, it\u2019s honestly too small to cycle around, you are better walking. There are various greenways across the country too, which are mostly completely removed from roads. They usually have bike hire at the start and end, so it\u2019s a nice family day trip. Look up greenways Ireland. I don\u2019t know anything about Derry cycling though.",
        "Salthill Playground in Galway is great. The aquarium isn't free, but we found it worth the cost, especially if you run into a rainy day. Charlie Byrne's Bookshop has a large variety of kids books if that's something your kid enjoys.\n\nIn Dublin, Merrion Square playground was our son's favorite. National Gallery of Ireland is right there too with free admission. We popped in because our son needed to use the potty after playground time and he ended up enjoying wandering around the museum aimlessly. St Patrick's Park has a small playground, although my son enjoyed running around the perimeter of the fountain more. If you end up there, consider checking out Marsh's library nearby. Interesting history for the adults and they do a great job engaging children. They've set up Lego figurines around the library and give kids a sheet to check off which ones they've found. Great staff - one of the librarians spent 20 minutes answering my 3 year old's oddball questions. The most random of our finds in Dublin, but the most enjoyable.\n\nProbably a bit out of your way, but depending on how you plan to get from Galway to Derry, there's a great bike path outside Westport. Bike hire with toddler accessories are available. [https://westportbikehire.com/](https://westportbikehire.com/) We were looking into doing this with our toddler, but ended up not being able to plan far enough ahead with unpredictable weather.",
        "That sounds really nice, thank you so much! Sounds like we will plan out a bike day instead of using it to get around town.",
        "That makes sense, thank you! We were planning on bringing our own helmet for him if we found some good bike leads. We are also used to biking as a family in Philadelphia and other American cities/towns that have little to no bike lanes or biking culture. But I am going to do some more research thanks to your suggestion to see if it would still be a good idea. In your opinion are drivers in Ireland at all aggressive towards bikes? Or are bikes pretty well accepted?",
        "The suburbs are very bike friendly, not as much as some European cities but nothing as bad as a lot of American cities.",
        "Get a rough itinerary ASAP. Do not do what I did and put the bookings to the last minute! It is expensive and accommodations (at least affordable ones) are in short supply.\n\nEven hostels in Dublin are charging $150+ per PERSON in a 6-12 person DORM room!\n\nOk assuming you follow the above advice. Here is my itinerary for 17 days. It is very FAST and i know a lot of people will criticize me for moving to quickly. I get it. I give the same \"Slow down\" advice to others. But I know me and my family and I know what we want to see and do so we have made a concious decision to move around alot with the understanding that if we want to just chill in a place rather than explore, we will do so.\n\nThat being said here is my 17 day itinerary for 4 people with a total cost UNDER $10k US (which to me seems like a LOT of $$$ since my first trip to Europe was almost 3 months and cost less than $3500 US total....man i miss the old days).\n\n**Dublin (2 nights)** \\-> Trinity College/Book of Kells, historic walking tour, St. Patricks Cathedral, Christ Church, Guinness Storehouse (overrated, but my we're doing it anyways),  \n**Kinsale (1 night)** \\-> explore the town, maybe visit Cobh (on way to Kinsale: Rock of Cahel, Hore Abbey, Blarney Castle)  \n**Kenmare (1 night)** \\-> drive the ring of kerry, Killarney National Park  \n**Dingle Peninsula (2 nights)** \\-> Drive the peninsula, ferry to Great Blasket, explore Dingle town, find a couple nice pubs and local music sessions  \n**Doolin (1 night)** \\-> Cliffs of Moher, chill in Doolin  \n**Inis Mor (Aran Islands)** (1 night) - Dun Aoghasa, bike the island or horse carriage tour  \n**Galway (2 nights)** \\-> explore Galway, find some trad music sessions, MAYBE explore the region and go out to Connemarra  \n**Westport (2 nights)** \\-> explore County Mayo, wifes great grand parents are from this area so might try to find the town they are from before leaving home so MAYBE we can visit that  \n**Portrush (Northern Ireland) (2 nights)** \\-> base for Antrim Coast exploration: Giant's Causeway, Dunluce Castle, Carrick a Reade rope bridge (for the kids), MAYBE a stop in Londonderry  \n**Belfast (2 nights)** \\- Black cab murals tour, see the segregation wall and the protestant neighborhoods (MAYBE). Titanic experience, Belfast Castle, a couple local pubs  \n**Cabra Castle (1 night)** \\-> stay in a castle on our last night.  \nNB4: Yes this is SUPER busy. I do not recommend this speed of travel for anyone. I don't even know if it will be good for me and my family and we ALWAYS travel fast to see a lot. But we have limited time and want to see a lot of places because we are not going back anytime soon: so many other countries/places we want to visit before returning somewhere.",
        "You will be able to do a lot of travel by public transport and visit some places by organised tours. That means you won't need to rent a car for the full holiday. With a little planning, you can reduce the car rental required. For example, if you fly into Dublin and were spending a few days in the city, you would have no need for a car while in the city. After that, from Dublin you can go by road or rail to all parts of the country, so no need for a car on that second leg. Even if you were going to another place in Ireland directly after getting off the plane, you could also do that by public transport. It is only if you want to go off the beaten track or do things in your own time, that you could use a car. Even then, that would probably be only for some of the time. You will be on holidays, so let someone else do the driving.\n\nWith two weeks, that gives you a lot of time to see things. You could have a few bases to work from. So stay a few days in Dublin and see the city and do day trips to Newgrange, Glendalough and places like that. Stay a few days in Galway and see Connemara, the Cliffs of Moher, the Aran Islands etc. You could find other bases too. That saves you always being on the move and sleeping in a different place every night and unpacking and packing every day. Settle in places for a few days and see something different in that area, before moving on.",
        "Thanks for the info! \n\nI do like the idea of a car\u2026 we were planning on doing an air bnb on the east, west, then north.  And drive to whatever activities we\u2019d wanna do in between. I\u2019m not a big fan of public transportation (lol) \nI\u2019ll look into it tho and see. We do want to do like hikes, and bike ride in inishmore island (a friend of mine did it and said it\u2019s a must!) haha\n\nWe were thinking a night or two in Dublin.  I\u2019m not a big fan of the big cities, I really wanna go see castles, little towns, etc.  After Dublin we\u2019d head south and kind of work our way around the country.  I looked up different destinations and everything is relatively close in travel time (I\u2019m from Canada so everything is mad far) 1-2h drive to a location is amazing \ud83d\ude02\n\nIs early September like the tail end of the busy season?..",
        "Well, Ireland is small. You can go from Dublin to Galway, east coast to west coast, in three hours. You would not be on public transport for long. You could sit back, relax and enjoy the journey. No worries about navigation, getting used to driving a different car and the other stresses, plus the cost. Get a car for some of the time, yes, but see what you can do by public transport.\n\nSeptember is past the peak of the season here, but it can still be busy. There is still plenty of daylight and the weather can be good, though Ireland's weather is unpredictable at any time. We could have a beautiful September, or it could be a washout. The first half of June was lovely here, but we have had a lot of rain since then. Other years July can be lovely.

We also stayed in the Sleepzone Galway (fine but small rooms, multiple toilets/shower stalls out of service) and the Belfast IYH (clean but spartan, some older bathrooms). Lus Mor was honestly probably my favourite hostel ever (and my group all wished we had spent longer there), but they are definitely easier to reach for people travelling by bike/car, but they do have info on their website about arranging pick ups. Everything else was fairly easy to get to.",
        "Thank you.  Let me check that out.   \nIn Northern Ireland, the Botanical Backpackers is also a good, clean hostel and still operating the Dorm Beds but in Doolin, and few other places it seems you have to rent the whole room.  \nIf you had traveled by Public transport in Ireland and can share your itinerary, that would be great.

        "You'll be fine using a roller suitcase here! The streets can be narrow in spots but Dublin and Belfast are both pretty flat so you won't have a huge amount of steps to deal with. \n\nJust bear in mind there is no underground system in Ireland (assume that's what you mean by metro). From the airport, you will either get a bus or taxi into the city centre. If you're getting a dedicated airport bus, they usually have additional space for bags downstairs so you will be able to store your bags there. There is an ordinary commuter bus (16 or 16A, I'm not sure) which is cheaper but will have limited space for bags. \n\nFrom Dublin to Belfast, you will either get an intercity bus or the train. The intercity buses are coaches, so plenty of space for your suitcase underneath the bus. The train will have some luggage storage at the entrance to each carriage.",

If you haven't already bought the train ticket I would swap that for the X1 translink bus. It's 9\u00a3 online and it'll take you through Drogheda, Newry and Belfast Europa and not  lanyon train station which is a little out of the way. \n\nSecondly I'd keep this link handy https://www.fonacab.com/ we don't hail cabs in Belfast. You either call em, ask hotels to call em or you book on their website. Or you can Uber. \n\nThere's an app called Mlink which we use to buy bus tickets for getting around the city. It's not necessary as you can buy on the bus but it's for sure easier. You just pay and show a code to the driver. \n\nTranslink.co.uk is the link for all your bus timetables.

We are staying at the Fitzwilliam so you just saved us a bunch of hassle from Lanyon. \n\nQuick question on that. Here in the states, the long distance buses are shiiiiitty. Sometimes literally. Busses have earned a bad reputation and trains are a bit more of a pleasant experience from more countryside views to an overall nicer experience with fellow passengers and the stations. Would you say the bus vs train has an obviously better experience if we want to really enjoy our trip between towns?\n\nCannot wait to be in your city! If you have a favorite pub I'm all ears.",
        "Just bear in mind that for the commuter buses (such as the 16 and 16A) they do not take card payments for a ticket so you need to have change as they also do not take notes.

The buses are big coaches I recommended the X1/X2 because they are bigger. The air coach is a little small imo. I get the bus, it saves money and it's pretty much the same view however you would see a bit more countryside on the train but not much more. The train is a bit more free for people to get drunk and start walking around which really irrks me. Had a carlsberg spilt on me on the train do maybe I'm bias.\n\nIf you have the time and want to go between towns a day trip to Drogheda is a good shout. The city isn't all that much but you can see newgrange. One of the oldest structures in the world. Like 5k years old. \n\nObviously depends on what you like but Kelly's cellars/ five points would be recommended 'irish bars' (way better than those Dubliners bars \ud83d\ude05) \n\nPlaces like sunflower, Henry's are also a good shout\n\nIf you want a nightclub Kremlin, limelight",

        "If in Belfast, do the Black Cab tour.  \n\nAnd Derry is lovely.  Looking at both sets of murals from the walls is an experience. \n\nIt's not so much that Malin Head is a must, it more that it is absolutely gorgeous.  It's a long drive out from Derry, surprisingly so.  A car would make it much easier. \n\nLook if you don't have a car.  Then spend a night in Belfast.  And travel down to Dublin, you'll be able to see stuff without using public transport. \n\nSeeing Ireland without a car is difficult.  In ten years you might come back and travel some of the country.",
        "Your Wednesday plan seems  too busy given you only land in Dublin at 10am (and it'll be another 30-60mins getting out of the airport). If you're on public transport, you'll need to allow about 4 hours minimum to get to Portrush. My suggestion would be the Aircoach or Dublin Express coaches from Dublin Airport to Belfast, then the train from GVS to Portrush. \n\nI would try and do Carrick A Rede and the Causeway on the same excursion. Maybe Bushmills distillery on the Wednesday afternoon and the others on Thursday?\n\nFriday transport plans look fine, but even though I live in Donegal, given you're time constrained I'd suggest just spending the day in and around Derry. Absolutely loads to see and fantastic places to eat. If your husband wanted he could get an early round in at Portatewart/Portrush on friday morning. I'd recommend staying in Derry that night, then getting the bus to Belfast Saturday morning. Train journey is long and will take you back the way you came on Friday anyway. \n\nIn Belfast I wouldn't bother with the castle, but as someone else has said, definitely consider a black cab tour and maybe the Crumlin Road Gaol. Not sure how into your food you are, but your suggestions there aren't going to be memorable - they're fairly run of the mill places!  I don't know anything about Kirkistown so no suggestions for you there!\n\nSwap out Dublin Castle for Kilmainham Gaol on Sunday and your Dublin option looks good. \n\nHope that's helpful!",
        "Thank you. If I cut Malin Head/light house and Kirkistown would you still suggest a car since the rest seem to be highly tourist visited by tours/buses, or accessible by train?",

        ">Ireland's public transportation is not as advanced? \n\nIt's pretty poor all around and very poor outside of the main cities. If you want to visit places like Wicklow national Park or Connemara you can't really do it without a car unless you want to join a tour group. \n\nIf you have the option to rent a car I'd strongly recommend it, you'll get a lot more freedom and will likely have a very different experience",
        "If you are here for eight days, that gives you some time to explore Dublin city. It is a coastal city and a rail service called the DART will bring you along some of that coast, which you might like. Going to Howth on the northern end of the line and Bray on the south, would be good. Dublin is also close to some mountains, just south of the city. A day tour to Wicklow would be a good idea.\n\nGetting further from Dublin, you can heard to the west coast. Anywhere from Kerry in the southwest up to Donegal in the northwest will give you some very nice scenery and nature to explore. Be it the Dingle Peninsula or Connemara or the hills and cliffs of Donegal, you will find no shortage of places to meet your requirements. Maybe aim to base  yourself in a few places, like Killarney for the Kerry area and Galway city for Connemara, for example. Get a good map of Ireland out and have a look so you can make some plans.",
        "Galway arts festival is on for two weeks from 17th July. If that matches with your dates you can book tickets on [GIAF.ie](https://www.giaf.ie/) .  The journey from Dublin airport to Westport is awkward and long by public transport (4hrs 45 using train according to Rome to Rio). You can get a Citylink bus from Dublin airport direct to Galway - stay in Galway. Then do Westport afterwards. It would break up that long journey on your first day.",
        "Thank you so much for the wonderful advice! We'll definitely check out the Galway Arts Festival, and we appreciate the suggestion to travel directly to Galway from the airport and then head to Westport afterward. Our current plan is to take a quick taxi to Heuston and then take the Irish Rail direct to Westport (3h 11min), but heading to Galway may just be easier per your suggestion.

        "Oh my goodness you poor thing! it's really easy (be glad!). Statistically I am going to assume you want to go to Dublin. If ya don't that is ok, but am just giving this off the bat since you didn't specify a location. \n\nFirstly, it's super easy. If you are in Dublin you want a leap card. You can buy this almost Everywhere (I think it's five euro). When you get it you can top it up by your phone with the leap card app. Once you have money on it then it's really simple. You go to your bus stop , hold out your arm when your bus comes, it stops and you hold your card to a big giant pad that everyone will hold their card to (trust me you can't miss it). Then your card will be deducted 2 euro. \n\nIt's that simple. Now, if you are travelling a really short journey you can go to the driver and hold your card to his pad. At this point you can say the name of your destination and he will take the right amount from you. Or you can just say the price \"1.30 please\". and they will take that off you if you are travelling a small amount. \n\nThat's all there is to it. There are only two prices. \n\nWhen in doubt ya can pay the extra seventy cents and just pay at the pad the driver is not using. If ya want to know what it is like here ya go: \n\nhttps://www.echolive.ie/cms_media/module_img/4310/2155058_1_seoimage16x9_Leap.jpg\n\n\nNow, the Luas is our tram system. Frankly that is ten time easier. You use the same leap card but you tap the pad (just like on the bus but on each luas station)before you get on and when you get off you tap the pad too. \n\nThat's it! It's really easy. Please do contact me if you feel confused.\n\nPS just know that you dont need a leap card. That is just one of a few methods you can use. In buses you can also pay by change. With the luas you can also buy a ticket which has a machine at every stop.\n\nThis can be a great trip for you, don't let you social anxiety get in the way. I see plenty of people who are irish who need to ask \"hey am i doing this right?\". Go easy on yourself :)",
        "Hi!! Just want you to know I felt this so hard and I hear your anxiety about this!! I just got back from a solo trip to Ireland and I promise you, the people there are quite literally the nicest human beings on the face of the planet. When I landed in Dublin and walked out of the airport, it was raining and I immediately got overwhelmed with trying to figure out how to get into city centre. Luckily, there are several buses basically right out front that say they\u2019re airport shuttles that take people to and from city centre, and the guy who worked at the airport could not have been sweeter, explaining to me how to buy my ticket and where to stand while I waited and to be out of the rain. I got into Dublin with no problems at all!\n\nI\u2019m following along with other people\u2019s comments that you\u2019re probably headed to Dublin? If so, I actually ended up up walking everywhere I needed to go. I understand that for a conference, you might need to go to some convention center outside of city centre or something, but just within the day-to-day functions of leaving your hotel, getting breakfast, exploring the city a little on your off time, you can absolutely walk most places.\n\nI use Apple Maps personally, and paid the extra $10/day on my phone plan specifically so that I could have precise location on while using it. I\u2019ve heard Google Maps is pretty accurate as well, but I feel like if whatever app you\u2019re using can pinpoint exactly where you are, it\u2019s going to be much easier to navigate which bus stop you need to be at and which bus you need to get on. Also, since public transport isn\u2019t a thing in South Africa, if you have any worries about it being gross or scary like it may seem in some parts of America, please don\u2019t! The buses I took both in Ireland and in Scotland were clean and properly taken care of. It\u2019s nothing like a New York City subway, thank goodness.\n\nFinally, if all else fails, please know that the bus drivers are kind and do have it in their heart to help you. I know that even knowing someone has good intentions in an interaction doesn\u2019t make actually going up and talking to them any easier, but they are good people and they understand if you don\u2019t know how things work. I\u2019ve always had social anxiety but I can truthfully say that my trip to Ireland helped me get over my anxiety in a lot of ways (on my first night in Dublin, I ended up meeting these strangers at a festival who I was out dancing and having the time of my life with until 3am who I still keep in touch with to this day- that is something I could NEVER do back home!) because of the compassion of its people. Your fears are so valid and I sincerely hope that you find comfort in having the info others have shared and in knowing that the people of Ireland are literal angels!! Have fun!!",
        "I live in Ireland and I 100% understand I\u2019m terrified of buses (well I was before I got here)! I use google maps and the TFI live app (sometimes the google one isn\u2019t right but it usually is). If you\u2019re going outside of Dublin I\u2019ve used the Bus \u00c9ireann services and those you just buy a ticket on the app  (TFI Go). None of these services you have to tell the bus driver where you get off, they do the same route and you just press the bell!\nIf you\u2019re getting the aircoach from the airport - you can buy ticket on their website or outside your terminal, the bus driver will ask you where you\u2019re getting off at and that\u2019s it, they\u2019re very lovely.\n\nYou\u2019ll be okay, I\u2019m much more comfortable with Dublin transport than with the public transport back home in England.",
        "You can read about it on [www.transportforireland.ie](https://www.transportforireland.ie)\n\nThere are apps you can download to your phone to give you the ETA as well as the scheduled time (which often are not exactly the same because traffic). You can buy tickets online in advance using these apps and you just have to show it to the driver when you get on, and often scan it with the device they have on the bus - no biggie. Also, you can tell the bus driver directly where you want to get off, like 'can you let me know where to get off for the Epic Museum?' for example. Not an issue, they get asked stuff like this all the time. Generally the stop is announced just before the bus or train stops at it, and then when they move away they announce the name of the next stop. \n\nAnd the great thing about public transport is that locals use it and you can easily strike up a conversation with them, and they'll give you all kinds of useful information about where you're going.",
        "I use an app called City mapper if I go somewhere new. It tells you which exactly which public transport to use (eg bus 100 from platform 3) and how much it costs so you can get cash ready if you want to. It works for Dublin if that is where you are headed.",

I'm not sure if that is possible either with public transport. \n\nA different option is Dublin mountains.  Taxi or bus out to Ticknock.  The edge of Dublin city comes right up to the mountains.  Take a look on AllTrails for length of walk options .",
        "I may be in the minority here, but I think Glendalough is overrated.  Mainly because the valley slopes have been logged and make it look ugly.\n\nUsing the DART, either head to Howth for the Howth Head walk, which is lovely, or head to Bray and go to Greystones over the top route of Bray Head (the lower route on the cliffs is closed due to landslides)",

        "Ireland trains to get between Dublin and a lot of different towns are actually really good and affordable, especially compared to the UK. \n\nHowever, getting out to hiking spots without a car will be much more difficult and getting between towns on trains is more difficult, especially in the West. Look up a rail line map of Ireland and you'll see what I mean. There are buses of course but they're slower, less comfortable and  not that frequent. \n\nThere are tour companies that will take you on day trips from the town centres, and some of them can take you to multiple places but then you're obviously on the bus schedule.",
        "The best thing to do is find a few bases for the day trips.  Dublin would be good as a base for Howth and Connemara.  Howth is not even a day trip.  It is a short train or bus ride from the city centre and you could spend just a few hours there, giving you plenty to time to do other things on that day.  Glendalough would take longer, but is a good place to visit.  As another example of a base, Galway would be good for going to the Aran Islands, Connemara and the Cliffs of Moher.  You can easily get a variety of day trips from Galway.\n\nIrish public transport is reasonably good for getting to the big towns and cities.  Getting to more remote parts is obviously a bit more awkward, and where a car would be useful.  Obviously that adds the problem of navigation and getting used to driving.  You can certainly get away with public transport, with a bit of planning.  Look at the idea of using several bases and then public transport or organised tours from those bases.",
        "Probably better to stay in Galway for Connemara, the Aran Islands and The Cliffs of Mother. Five days would be possible to fill, but it would be good to see other places too, so I would say cut that back and use a day or two to go elsewhere.\n\nFor Howth, if you look at a nap, you can see it is very close to the city centre. It would depend on exactly where you are staying, but it is an easy place to get to. There is a small seaside village there and you can do some walks around the area. If you took your time you could get hours out of it, but you could get a lot of other things done on the same day. In the same theme, you could use the rail line that goes north from the city to Howth and also head south of the city towards D\u00fan Laoghaire, Bray and Greystones. Add all of those places to the list and you could fill a day.",
        "I gotta be honest, doolin to dingle is a hellish slog on public transport.  You're going from rural to rural, so you'll see the weakest links in our bus network at both ends.\n\nYou're looking at Doolin to Ennis, Ennis to Limerick, Limerick to Tralee, and Tralee to Dingle.  All-in you're looking at a full day of travel - like 8+ hours of busses vs 3 hours of driving.\n\nI use a site rome2rio.com for scoping out trips like this.  It's global, but within Ireland it does pretty well with national (public&private) bus & rail services, but it does seem to be missing some of the very rural private bus services.\n\nI will say though - don't underestimate driving here.  I know what you mean, I spent a few years in Michigan and driving there is totally different.  Wider roads, straighter roads, miles and miles of cruise control.  Driving around Claire is going to be about as different as you can get (while staying on pavement).\n\nOn the other hand - do keep in mind we have short days in the winter, we're deceptively far north.  I'm in Galway, we're about as far north as Edmonton, Alberta.  In the middle of feb you're still looking at 8am-6pm daylight, so 8 hours on a bus is a whole day of daylight.\n\nOverall - I would recommend renting a car, but I would be careful planning long drives (unless it's something like the ring of kerry where that's the whole point).  For a pro-tip on our road numbering, road numbers starting with M are our version of freeways, no problem.  Roads starting with N are national and are mostly fine.  Roads starting with R are regional and are going to be more work than you're used to.  And roads starting with L are local and [can vary wildly](/r/ireland/comments/ciftbm/surprisingly_not_photoshop/) - so drives hitting a lot of R and L roads are going to be a lot more tiring than Google betrays.",
        "Dingle is nice but easier to explore with a car, unless you're on a guided tour. From Dingle town you could get bus to Tralee or Killarney to get the train back to Dublin - or if you're not wanting a car, Killarney might be a better bet. You're right near the national park and you could get a boat trip across the lakes etc. easier to get to from Galway than Dingle I'd think, and the rail station is in the centre of town.",

You can fly into either Cork or Dublin, personally I would choose Cork. If you do, then I strongly recommend just hiring a car and heading off out towards Kinsale and beyond.

Blarney Castle complex is wonderful, the castle itself is nothing special - yeah, there's that kissing the stone thing, but given that Covid numbers are still high in Ireland, I wouldn't.

        ">We are thinking of staying in Dublin for two nights, and then Cork for two nights.\n\nSounds fairly hectic. Factoring in travel, airport, and commuting time between the cities. Time spent getting between attractions and even - getting some sleep.\nYou might be biting off more than you can chew? Especially since travelling with a one year old can be like manuvering the 5th armoured column.  :-)\n\nYou might think about choosing either Cork or Dublin?\n\nAssuming you're choosing one or the other. I'll argue the case for Cork, and I'll let other posters make the case for Dublin.\n\n- Cork airport is much easier to use and more convenient than Dublin airport.\n- Cork is a great walking city. You can walk to most attractions in the city centre.\n- If Blarney Castle, visiting a small town and seeing the countryside is on your bucket list in Ireland. Then Cork is perfect (see below).\n- Dublin is a big city. With all the advantages and disadvantages that brings. Things go at a more leisurely pace in Cork. The city is more relaxed.\n\n>We\u2019ll probably catch public transport between Cork-Blarney Castle, and Cork-Cobh.\n\nI wouldn't waste time looking for bus stops and waiting for buses to Blarney Castle. A taxi to Blarney from the city centre will set you back around 30 Euros ($47 AUD). Use the Free Now taxi app to order a taxi near you, I use it all the time. It works all over Ireland.\n\nThere's a train from Cork city to Cobh. It takes around 25 mins and the views of the harbour are spectacular. It's the only way to travel to Cobh IMO.\n\nAlong the way, you might want to check out Fota Wildlife Park. It's ideal for a relaxed family day out. The weather should be fine in April/May.\n\n>Are there any places on these train trips that we could get off to have a bit of a walk/explore of some smaller towns/ beautiful countryside?\n\nThis should be no problem. Given that Cobh is a charming, small town in itself. Make sure to check out the wonderful Cathedral and the Titanic Museum, near the centre of town.\n\nBlarney Castle is set on a wonderful estate with extensive, award-winning gardens. You could also rent a taxi per hour if you wish. Probably easier and cheaper than renting a car. Ask the driver to bring you to the countryside.\n\nLast tip: you might want to check out the whale watching off the Cork coast.

        "Visited Ireland in October.  I did a Rail Tour to the Cliffs of Moher and Connemara, it was 2 days, included hotel and the bus tour tickets, cost about $360 and it was absolutely gorgeous.  A lot of people naturally recommended seeing the Cliffs but I did not know a thing about Connemara and that was just as beautiful as the Cliffs, just a different landscape.\n\nAlso did a Rail. Tour to Cork, Ring of Kerry, Killarney and that was also wonderful.  Even if you don\u2019t do RailTours, look up their website to get ideas.\n\nAlso if you are a fan of Game of Thrones take a Winterfell Trek Tour.  I did a one day tour.  It took us from Dublin to Northern Ireland, besides being fun and interesting , we were in some beautiful forests, parks in Northern Ireland.",
        "All I can say for definite is you won't be able to land on the Skelligs anyway that time of year. Public Transport outside of a major urban centre can be hit and miss, so if it's somewhere like the Cliff of Moher you're looking at going to, an organised bus trip might be your best bet (those would be weather dependent too)",
        "If you are going from Galway to Derry go straight there, don\u2019t return to Dublin, it\u2019s going completely in the wrong direction. Derry is worth seeing, especially if you are interested in the history of The Troubles. It\u2019s an awkward place to get to though so you could cut it out and just go Galway, Dublin (drop car) Belfast on public transport, Dublin Airport. Dublin airport is the Belfast side of Dublin so you might be able to stay in Belfast on your last day and go straight from Belfast to Dublin airport if the public transport allows it time wise.",
        "It\u2019s gonna be hard to get directly to Bushmills from Belfast, but if you catch the train to Coleraine you can then get the Causeway rambler bus to Bushmills- that same bus will take you to the Causeway (actually I just looked- you can get a bus directly to Bushmills- who knew!). It runs regularly enough, like every half hour to 45 minutes, but stops in the early evening so make sure to account for that! The TransLink trip planner app is good to get that information. Bushmills to Derry you\u2019ll get that same bus to Coleraine and get on the train to Derry. I\u2019m not familiar with the biking situation or transport to Donegal unfortunately. Taxis are usually cheaper and have more of a presence than Uber, you can either call, find a taxi stand, or just find one on the street. If you\u2019re in Derry you can get a bus or train quite easily to one of the Belfast stations and then take local transport to the airport, or get the \u201cAirporter\u201d coach that will take you directly there. Best of luck!\n\nETA: both Belfast and Derry are pretty walkable, especially with the main things you\u2019ll probably want to see. I think biking should be fine, but it\u2019s definitely not the infrastructure of somewhere like the Netherlands. Otherwise both cities have local public transport as well.",
        "Get yourself a hotel near the city centers and you won\u2019t need to bike at all. Most places are within 10 minutes of each other and the few places that are further you can taxi to. This is a better option than wrangling a bike around.  This applies to each of the cities you\u2019ll be traveling through, especially Donegal. That is not a big town at all.  \n\nIt is unfortunate that you won\u2019t be able to get a rental while touring NI and Donegal, because the most beautiful places up you\u2019d likely need a car to get to. Though there should be some sort of bus tour that would get you around the Antrim coastline for places like Giants Causeway, Dunluce Castle, Carrick-a-rede, the temple, and others.\n\nI\u2019m not great with public transportation in Ireland, but keep searching bus tours for Northern Ireland or Antrim and maybe you\u2019ll find what you need",

        "Most if all the hostels I picked out are an hour or only 30min walks from the centers, but I wanted to go out and just explore as well. Especially Donegal. \nAre there not many places to leave a bike locked up ? I also don't know any biking etiquette for cities heh.",
        "I don\u2019t recall many places for bike lock ups, but I\u2019m sure they exist.  I don\u2019t suggest bikes where walking is just as easy though because I remember the days on my campus that had loads of lock up points but the hassle of lock up and unlocking a bike and where it could go versus how fast I got around on my feet made me give up taking the bike.

There are many independent bus route operators who run one or two lines, and Rome2Rio will point them out to you (as well as the Irish Rail and Bus Eireann routes).\n\nBelfast has the best city transit system in Ireland (they have buses, bus rapid transit, and trains). Cork City has a commuter rail line line that connects Midleton and Cobh. Limerick City has a decent bus network, and is fairly close to Shannon Airport. Dublin has commuter rail and the Luas tram system, but only buses running to the airport. The city has a lot of traffic jams which slow down the buses and trams.",

We chose Killarney National Park, the Dingle peninsula, Aran Islands and the Cliff of Moher as destinations and we searched for the best way to go from one to the other with public transportation. \n\n If could be helpful for you I can provide more info about our plan.",
        "It is absolutely doable. Echoing what others have said, plan your public transport in advance.\n\n\\-Buy train tickets well in advance, as the tickets get more expensive in the days before and very expensive the day of departure.\n\n\\-Some buses only take credit card, so make sure you have a popular brand like MasterCard or Visa, preferably without international fees.\n\n\\-Some buses only take exact change, like the local buses in Dublin. (The Luas light rail takes credit card though.)\n\n\\-Buses departing from major cities like Dublin and Galway will depart right on time. Buses arriving/departing from small villages could be hours late. I waited for 4 hours for my bus in Adare -\\_-\n\nAlso, I would revisit the idea that making the most of your time = visiting as many places as possible.

If the weather is decent, you could take a walk from Dooagh to the Deserted Village. \n\nIf Kylemore Abbey tickets are included in the day tour then go for it, as they're one of the most expensive in the country (twice the price of the Cliffs of Moher) and the gardens/buildings are a little disappointing. I would prefer Pine Island or even up to Cong instead for a day.",

        "As others have said, i'd cut out Northern Ireland from this trip. The Antrim coast and Giant's Causeway is great, but that will be rushed at BEST, and at worst will be too fast of a day to see anything at all, especially if you plan to sight see Belfast and take a Black Cab tour (which i HIGHLY recommend as it was our TOP thing we did in Belfast.).\n\nBut as others have said: Leave Northern Ireland for the next trip.\n\nI'd also make a couple other edits, and I have aded suggestions:\n\n1. Dublin: Since you will hopefully nix Northern Ireland, you'll now have 2 days in Dublin. When I was there in July/August we did this:\n   1. Day1: St. Stephens Green->Grafton St -> Trinity College with Tour and Book of Kells-> Temple Bar District, skipped the pubs here to find non-touristy ones later -> River and crossed the Ha Penny Bridge->O'Connell Street and the Post Office (do some pre-trip reading on Dublins history to have an idea of the importance of the Post Office and other sights on O'Connell)->pubs;\n   2. Day 2: Dublin Castle, tour->Christ Church, self tour->Dublinia (i'd probably opt for the Archaeology Museum but I have kids and they enjoyed this more)->St. Patrick's Cathedral->Guinness Storehouse->Brazen Head pub and a pub crawl if you didn't yesterday. Consider the following:\n      1. O\u2019Donaghues Bar, \n      2. Mulligans Pub, \n      3. The Palace Bar, \n      4. Temple Bar ( i know i said the bars in Temple Bar district were more touristy, but it's worth a expensive pint to say you were here as a tourist)\n      5. Brazen Head\n2. Galway - not much to edit/reco. Galway is a fun walk through (start at Eyre Square, walk through the pedestrian streets, grab a fish & chips at O'Donagh's (spelling?) and stop at the Spanish Arch. Enjoy the street vendors and performers. maybe grab a pint at king's head or other pub We did love the drink concoctions made at the Galway Distillery Co. and enjoyed walking in Salt Hill along the beach/promenade.\n3. I know some people are reco'ing AGAINST conemarra and Kylemore abbey, but we loved both and I highly recommend. If nothing else just seeing Kylemore from the outside in its setting was worth it. The region is great.\n4. Inis Mor! This was one of my favorite days of our 17 day trip. I tried HARD to find a place to stay on the island, but i was last minute and there during their busiest time of year. BUT, you can definitely see a lot with a full day trip like you have planned. Hop on the first ferry to the islands (9ish i think).\n   1. As soon as you arrive, walk the 200 yards to the bike rental spot and get an E-bike (I got a pedal bike b/c i enjoy cycling my son got an e-bike, and their bikes are NOT the same as my racing bike at home and i hard a much harder time keeping up with my son than i like to admit). Make sure the bike has a little basket. \n   2. Stop at the nearby grocery store for snacks and drinks for a picnic lunch. \n   3. Head up the \"high/main\" road towards Seven Sisters Church (if you want to save time or did not get an E-bike, skip this location). \n   4. Then head to Dun Angus fort. \n   5. Then head to the Worm's hole. This was hard to find so hopefully you see people walking to or from it when you finally find the spot to leave your bikes - keep an eye out for the SMALL signpost pointing to the road to the worm hole on the way to Dun Angus and back. Careful on the rocks to the worm hole - this is NOT the place for flip flops or sandals! \n   6. Take the \"low\" road back near the beach and along the water. You'll have a chance to see a seal colony sun bathing on the nearby rocks.\n   7. Make sure to be back to Joe Watty's pub for a final pint and mabe food before the final ferry leaves at 4:30 (i think). Sit at the bar. Talk to any locals there or the bar keep. Maybe meet Grace, the owner. This was definitely a highlight of our trip - the local men and Grace told us stories of the island and history. I bought them a round, they bought us a flight of whiskey. Many laughs were had and they promised to put me up if they made me miss our ferry back. They were great people - friendly and warm and kind and funny. \n   8. Assuming you make the ferry, you'll be back to Galway around 6p (i think. we took the Doolin ferry and i am not sure if there is a difference in travel times).\n\nAs others have said, don't try to pack too much in BUT if you do keep the places you have included AND do cut Northern Ireland, the above edits/suggestions should help out a bit.\n\nHave a great trip!",

If you're in Dublin I would not get a rental car, it's busy and you don't really need it imo because public transportation and walking will pretty much get you anywhere. Renting a car is worth it if you're leaving Dublin because then you have freedom to see whatever you want. We were there for two weeks and saw Dublin/also took a bus to Howth which was beautiful, northern Ireland (giants causeway), Galway, Doolin, and Dingle. I personally really enjoyed the smaller towns like Doolin and Dingle because they're more quiet, and the live music was wonderful there. Everywhere is stunning in Ireland and I feel like no matter where you go you won't be missing out because there's a lot to see, and a lot to experience.

Before that either use the JustPark app or put coins in the meter. \nFYI, in front (north) of the city hall is a pedestrian shopping area. \n\nMulti storey car parks are a bit more expensive than the on-strret parking.\n\nBeware some lanes are bus lanes during mon-sat 7am-7pm, don't drive in these or the automatic cameras will catch you.\n\nThe people in Belfast are friendly, but the accent is more harsh and appears less friendly than the rolling tones of the Dublin accent. A native Cork accent is a whole different matter, something to be experienced! \n\nThere is good public transport within Belfast but you'll need a car to get to the Gobbins visitor centre.\n\nWhile in Belfast, you may want to take a hop on hop off bus that brings you to the places of interest, and see Belfast Castle, the peace walls etc.",
        "I can only comment on Galway, Cork, and Dublin but they are easy to get around without a car if you are staying in the city or driving in and parking. Most people will especially recommend no car in Dublin. You can walk most places in 25 minutes or less. The busses and tram in Dublin are pretty easy (just make sure you flag the bus or it will drive by and know that the tracker on google backs sometimes says your bus already left but is wrong) and you can get a leap card at any Spar or Centra or pay exact change. Taxis are expensive and not much faster if you\u2019re traveling within the city. \n\nI\u2019d personally recommend finding reasonably priced parking close to the city if you\u2019re staying somewhere that isn\u2019t walkable and parking for the day. Or take a bus into town if you\u2019re near a bus stop. \n\nGalway has the most reasonably priced car parks of those three. \n\nI\u2019m the same with planning. I want flexibility but don\u2019t want to miss stuff. I usually check tickets for the next 1-2 days on the day of the week I would be going (a couple of weeks before) to get an idea of how booked the experience gets. If I notice they are selling out, I\u2019ll go ahead and book. If they have a bunch of times/tickets left, I feel better about last minute plans. I don\u2019t know if I explained that very well but that method seems to work for me.",
        "What ..... all those long distances - you're trusting Google for driving times? Fine, but you need to be aware that Google only bases its calculations on the speed limits of the roads in question. It doesn't take into consideration other traffic, delays caused by farm traffic (cattle on roads, tractors, slurry trailers, trucks, etc.) or other issues (tourist traffic, accidents, funerals, construction work). You need to allow a LOT more time than Google indicates for such incidents, and of course you'll want to stop and take pictures and stretch the legs along the way too. I mean, you could take the motorway from Cork city to Dublin and then on to Belfast, but you'll miss so much along the way. \n\nFrankly this is MUCH too spread out. You want to visit Ulster AND Cork? Why so much driving?",
        "If you're outside the city look up the translink website for Blue buses that go into the city. The pink buses just travel inside the city.",
        "Been there 5 times. Don\u2019t really need a travel agent. I usually just do some online research. I like the Rick Steves guidebooks. Cheapest way to get euros is just to use an atm. Make sure your bank card will work in Ireland, most do. Make sure that your bank doesn\u2019t charge fees for foreign currency. Dublin is a very walkable city and they have Uber along with a decent rail system that goes around the city. The bus system goes much anywhere. The train system only seems to go to major cities (www.irishrail.ie) many places have WiFi, Dublin is a pretty modern city, the country side not so much. Although my favorite parts of Ireland is the west (Dingle, Galway, Cobh, Cork,,Sligo) there are plenty of places in Dublin that do day bus tours to the ring of Kerry, Belfast, etc\u2026..Temple bar is very tourist heavy. If you want to see the real Ireland just go to a small town and walk into a random pub, you\u2019ll make friends in no time. Irish are very friendly and will talk to you. They love a good conversation. If you have Amazon prime watch the movie The Irish Pub, gives you an idea of the culture and ideas for what pubs to check out. \n  Live music is plentiful. Most pubs have live traditional music with no cover. \n\nAny questions, let me know",
        ">Dun Laoghaire\n\nThanks for the suggestions! I will have to check them out! Bonus points for it being easy with public transport.",
        "I went to Inis Oirr as a solo traveller. I stayed there overnight. It's the smallest island so it's easy to get around. They have horse and trap tours as well as bike hires. I think there is also bus tours as well. And there were plenty of pubs, cafes and restaurants. Inish M\u00f3r which is the biggest Island has lots to do as well. From what I have heard Inis M\u00f3r is more developed than the other islands. Inis Mean is the middle one and not as popular as the other two. You can go for the day or stay overnight on them.",
        "Yes! Deffo great places to visit regarding public transport. Ireland's public transport isn't the best, but as someone who also navigates Ireland via public transport, I've found these two places easy to get to by using only public transport. Wexford has a direct bus to it from Dublin, but Dun Laoghaire especially is the perfect day out by using public transport. The train is superb and quick, and you get a lovely view of the sea whilst on it, plus 5 euro for a return ticket is pretty grand! Along with it being a short journey means you can do more in your day. Safe travels!",
        "Are you using public transport to get around or are you renting a car?",
        "Was trying to keep it to public transport for the days that I am running solo.",
        "We booked train ticket from Galway to Athenry the morning of. It's cheaper if you book online and then print your tickets at the train station. We took Gobus from Dublin to Galway and back, and booked ahead  which is the best idea, because they were fully booked (excellent service, by the way). \nThe DART service out of Dublin, we didn't book ahead and paid with our visitor LEAP cards ( don't forget to buy one at the airport). DART will take you to the very cool villages outside of Dublin, on the coast.\nProbably from city to city, it's a good idea to book a day or so ahead online, whether it's train or Gobus or Citylink. Also  bus 350 from Galway to the Cliffs of Moher gets busy, so buy that ticket a day ahead too.\nAnd yes, you might want to eliminate one city from your plans. Like you say, you don't want to spend so much time travelling.\nWe had a great time on the public transportation, I hope you enjoy it!",
        "You don't NEED to book ahead, but it's strongly recommended for certain days and times, especially during the summer when there are a lot of tourists, many of whom will also be using the available public transport.",
        "When I spent 2 weeks in Ireland, I stayed in an AirBNB in Shannon. There was a rail station nearby in Limerick which was great for when I wanted to go into Dublin. I did find that the price of the rail ticket was cheaper if I purchased it a day or so before. (As advised by an Irish friend before I got there!) There was also a tour (went to Ring of Kerry and Killarney) that left from Limerick. Pretty sure the price was the same either way (day of or day before). Paddywagon tours I believe it was. They were great.",
        "Public transport can be busy, especially at peak times. And the way hotels have been going this season, planning and booking isn't a terrible idea. No, it's not free spirit travelling but it gets you to the places you want to be at",
        "Public transportation is fine with the major cities, but very sporadic in the smaller towns and rural areas, and that's where I've always considered the heart of Ireland to be located.\n\nDriving on the left wasn't bad at all. Rental cars usually have stickers on the windshield, reminding you. Because the driver is on the right side of the car, just remember that the driver is still next to the median of the road. \nFor me, the bigger issue is Ireland's narrow, twisting roads. But most of the best scenes in Ireland require driving a mile down a two-way road barely wide enough for one car. I just take it slow, and if I come across another car, I pull over wherever I can, as far as I can, and just stop. I let the other driver go around me.\n\nIf you fly into Dublin, I'd recommend spending two full days there. You definitely don't need a car there.",
        "I had similar concerns but reversed, coming from Ireland and renting a car in Greece. I found the changeover much easier than expected, though with a few minor mistakes. You should be fine after your first day on the other side. It really helps to have someone in the passenger seat spotting signs and hazards and flagging them to you on the first couple of days, as you (the driver) will spend more time fixating on your immediate surroundings. After a while though muscle memory kicks in and it's just like driving back at home. \n\nIt's true that seeing the best of the countryside means turning down very narrow roads, which can be particularly daunting if coming from the US with it's generally much wider road network. But you just take it slow and easy and pull into the nearest farm gate if there's an oncoming tractor!\n\nIf you use public transport, you'd be fine in places like Dublin and Cork. And Galway can just be walked around really. Outside these towns, public transport is reliable in getting you to major tourist attractions. However, there are countless lesser known but equally great sights that would be more difficult to get to. Not impossible, you'd just need more planning and much more time. There are plenty of bus tour companies that would offer several sights in one day that might be handy if you want to get out of the towns but aren't comfortable driving.\n\nAs for can't-miss towns / attractions... It depends on what you like and where you're aiming geographically. The usual towns that are heavily visited are Cork and Galway. Cork City is great and Cork County has some incredibly beautiful landscapes, with plenty of attractions in short distance from the city, like Charles Fort in Kinsale, Cobh or Spike Island.\n\nFurther north, places like Sligo, Leitrim and Donegal have some breathtaking landscapes (e.g. Sliabh Liag). And nearby Co. Mayo has some beautiful spots that are less visited than others on the Atlantic coast. Many are best visited by car.\n\nIf you're looking inland, you have great towns like Kilkenny and Cashel (the Rock of Cashel is a must-see if possible). You can do cruises along the R. Shannon, or take a ferry out to some Islands off the West coast. All of these are easily facilitated by public transport.\n\nFor breweries & hiking, a car is generally best. However you can get public transport to places like the Wicklow Wolf brewery, where you're also at the foot of the Wicklow Uplands where there are countless hiking routes, just outside Dublin. For distilleries, you have Roe & Co and the Jameson distilleries in Dublin (the latter is a major tourist attraction), then maybe Tullamore distillery in Co. Offaly in the midlands, and several others around the country.",
        "Avoca woollen mill in Wicklow ( original location) sounds like a must for you. But public transport to it might not be a runner. Some nice hikes around there too.",
        "Driving on the left isn\u2019t too bad, and it only takes a short time to get used to it. I\u2019ve been to Ireland 5 times and have rented a car for 4 of those trips. Most of my time has been in the west, on the Dingle peninsula, so the roads are usually narrower. In my experience, the other drivers are a lot less aggressive than in the US, and I didn\u2019t find the smaller roads to be a problem.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in hiking, there is a lot on both the Dingle and Iveragh peninsulas in Kerry. I visited the Gap of Dunloe for the first time on my latest trip, and it was as spectacular as I\u2019d hoped. There are numerous trails off the gap road that climb the mountains; we stuck to the road this time but will probably return to hit the trails. In Dingle, you can walk from town to a path that follows the southeast curve of the harbor to Hussey\u2019s Folly and the lighthouse. If you continue on this trail, you can go to Beenbawn beach and beyond. There is another great trail just past the fire station that goes up to Cnoc a Cairn, where you can get amazing views of Dingle town and harbor. One branch of this trail goes all the way up to Conor Pass.\n\nI\u2019m obviously biased toward Kerry, but Dingle has both a brewery at Dick Mack\u2019s and the Dingle Distillery has a fun tour. To the south, the Ring of Kerry is incredible, and has places like the Cill Rialaig Art Center and amazing scenery. \n\nHappy anniversary!",
        "Why doesn't anyone go to County Donegal? Amazing scenery, Glenveagh, Slieve League, Fanad Head, and maybe stay in Letterkenny. Maybe the limitation is public transportation to these spots?",
        "Have you tried asking Bus Eireann?",
        "Also, we were at the stations an hour early, but it didn't matter. When the bus shows up, people don't really form a line, they just crowd around the bus door. Even when the buses fill up, they let people stand on them.",
        "Thank you for the answer! Can you give me more info about your experience with those buses? Did you arrive a lot of time in advance to take a seat or 10-15 minutes before the departure times are enough?",
        "When you land, spend that day in Dublin and get the train to Galway the next morning. You'll be shattered after your flight and a 3 hour bus journey jammed between loud Irish people will not give you a great first impression. The train is a **much** better option to Galway, you'll be able to book online at irishrail.ie and reserve a seat so you don't have to worry about late buses.\n\nI'd recommend a day in Cork if you have a day to spare,  lots to see and do, Titanic Experience, and Deck of Houses in Cobh. Blarney Castle not too far either if you want to follow the footsteps of countless Americans.",
        "There won't be time to go on tours around Galway AND cruise to the Aran Islands in one day. Pick one or the other - I'd suggest spending your first full day in Galway city. I'd be reluctant to plan a definite trip to the Aran Islands because in February weather conditions could cause it to be cancelled. I would spend 2 nights in Galway at least. \n\nCheck that bus to the Cliffs of Moher - might not be running in the low season. It might be better to join a tour, you can contact the tourist office in Galway about that, or try [www.discoverireland.ie](https://www.discoverireland.ie). \n\nGalway to Dingle is a very long bus journey, you'd need to get up quite early for it. Now you could break it up with a night someplace else along the way, like Limerick city. You'll have at least one change of buses, probably 2. And because it's that long and getting around the Dingle peninsula is hard after Dingle town, I would aim to stay there for at least 2 nights.",
        "Each to their own, I travel this route hundred times a year and would prefer the train every time (plus much faster and cheaper than bus). Irish buses are unreliable, filthy and if you can nap on them you could sleep through a hurricane.\n\nMuch better to stay in Dublin after a long fight from Chicago to rest and see the country properly in my opinion.",
        "Irish people are a fucking nightmare on public transport, if it's not some hungover wankers shouting to talk to each other it's some teenagers blaring music on their phones.",
        "How long have you been driving? Do you know how to drive stick? I just came back from there and I had fun. I opted for an automatic transmission so that I'd have one less thing to worry about. Here's my take on driving in Ireland. In american we have bigger lanes on our streets then ireland an a lot of europe does which is really interesting when you have a bus coming towards you the other direction. The highways are nice and big and they have those raised reflectors on them to help you stay in your lane (I've heard them called road turtles before). But I found most of my driving was done on back roads so be ready for a lot of single lane roads with hedges right up against the freaken road. Honestly I had a great time driving roughly the same parts your going to drive. But Dublin was not as fun. It's a lot if one way streets and certain streets were for buses only during certain times and my GPS didnt know this so I could of easily gotten a ticket. Maybe the cops are use to it so it's not a big deal but I dont know that. The part I couldn't believe was some of the posted speed limits on the country roads were freaking insane. It was posted as 80 km/hr but I was only comfortable doing 60 so dont feel pressured in doing the speed limit cause I saw a lot of locals only doing 60 too. It took me two days to relax into driving so have fun and make sure you have a good navigator with you. Someone who wont stress you out and have fun with it. It's beautiful driving I found.",
        "Not sure if an international student id is valid for student discounts here, you'd have to check the terms and conditions. \n\nLeap card is the name of the cashless ticket system here, leapcard.ie is their website. But you don't need one, and a tourist one is only really useful short term in an urban setting. \n\nThere's some intercity rail, semi decent bus coverage between cities and alright to patchy local buses around some cities/urban centres. \n\nReally what I'd say to you is plot where you want to go and then meticulously google the transport options. Without any sort of itinerary we can only give you broad strokes and you need specifics. \n\nTransport for Ireland is the new public transport umbrella, they have a website and a couple of apps that will be of use, especially as there are many private transport operators around the country who run in lieu of or better than government funded ones",
        "remember there are two different countries on the island of ireland so with two different public transport systems in Ireland (aka the Republic of Ireland) its Bus Eireann and Irish rail, in Northern Ireland its translink they run all buses and trains in NI links below\n\n[www.buseireann.ie](https://www.buseireann.ie)\n\n[www.irishrail.ie](https://www.irishrail.ie)\n\n[www.translink.co.uk](https://www.translink.co.uk)",
        "https://www.transportforireland.ie/\n\nDon't be worrying about leap cards too much time and hassle. Plan where you want to go and what mode of transport. This website and Google are your greatest assets. The people of Ireland are very hospitable so don't ever be afraid to ask somebody for directions or what direction to take. You will be surprised the lengths we will go for each other so take advantage of that and give back in return. The government transport organisations are practically indistinguishable from one another. Google will provide you with numbers to ring for these organisations so you can always call them and ask for information. Just don't forget to be courteous even if you get a grumpy fecker, it's their job.\nIf you're only planning on staying around Dublin perhaps a leap card is viable after surveying your options but that's up to you to decide as you need to figure out the specifics. However if you plan on going outside of Dublin and you don't have time to waste, I would suggest getting the train to the neatest town/city of your destination and considering bus options from there. Just be considerate that most buses to rural areas will cease around 5/6 in the evening so plan accordingly.\nHave a nice time and if you plan on visiting the Dolmen Rock (largest monolithic capstone in Europe) I'm only down the road so let me know lol",
        "So you\u2019re suggesting that it\u2019s more convenient to buy individual bus and train tickets instead of buying a leap card? Do I buy bus tickets in the buses? Or at a station? Thanks for the tips!",
        "You can use it but it for everything but if you\u2019re going to make long journeys it\u2019s better to book in advance instead of on the leap card. Irish transport is a bit weird like that. Or if you are taking a long bus from Dublin to Galway the city link doesn\u2019t accept leap cards but it\u2019s only 10\u20ac so not huge deal.\n\nYou can add money at the shops. Just say you wanna top it up/put money in it. You need to put atleast 5\u20ac each time. But you can download the app Leap Top-Up to add money from your phone. But maybe that\u2019s only on the Irish App Store in apple. Not sure. But you can also add money at any Train station or LUAS stop alternatively if you don\u2019t wanna do a shop.",

        "You could bring the kids to the rugby match, if they don't like it you can always leave again. However if you don't think they will like it and you really want to go, you might have to leave them with a babysitter.\n\nLots of beaches along the coast there, take your pick. Look for 'blue flag' beaches, they are the ones with lifeguards on duty. Some will also have surfing classes and bodyboarding. The water is very cold so you'll have to  rent wetsuits.\n\nBunratty Castle and Folk Park between Limerick and Ennis is a nice spot for kids. In addition to the model town and the castle, there are reconstructed cottages from various parts of Ireland and a working farm in the complex. A great place for a family day out.\n\nI'd also suggest LAW, which is the Limerick Animal Welfare sanctuary near Kilfinnane in County Limerick, they love having visitors to 'help out', you get to meet the horses and goats on the farm and even walk a dog if you like, all they ask is a donation. Now, it IS way off the beaten tourist track, but the area it's in has some really cool places for forest walking, mountain biking, and you can also visit some ancient ruins in the area like the Grange Stone circle and Stone Age village beside Lough Gur, and the mediaeval town of Kilmallock is easy to explore and has some really cool buildings that are hundreds of years old. The region is known as Ballyhoura country and there are worse places to stay for 3 or so nights! It's also close enough to Limerick, Cahir, Cashel, the Glen of Aherlow, Doneraile (Doneraile Court and Wildlife park is great) and Limerick city to be a good base for longer day trips.\n\nAnother super location is Kells Bay down on the Ring of Kerry Peninsula, it's near Caherciveen and Valentia Island (tetrapod tracks, mining activities, and an old telegraph station, plus a great view of Skellig Michael, weather permitting). Also nearby are ancient stone forts, ruined castles, beaches ..... If you're really lucky you'll see pods of dolphins swimming. Please note that wild dolphins can be quite dangerous. Derrynane Strand and the Caherdaniel area is stunning and great for families, and there are boat trips in the area. Close to Kenmare is Gleninchaquin Park with a stunning waterfall and some lovely walks. You might also be able to get the cable car over the sea to Dursey Island - on the B\u00e9ara Peninsula, it was out of commission for a few months because it needed replacing so check that out first.",

        "You can absolutely follow the different hiking trails around the National park. Many are within walking distance. Of course not all, but you'll see most parts (the entrance, abbey and castle, torc mountain is a beautiful hike, and near torc waterfall there is another hiking that ends up on the ring itself, also you can do the gap of dunloe, you only need a bus to one of the parkings but you can get it in any tourism centre in Killarney and they are cheap).\n\nIf you cycle, you can rent a bike and that will give you some more freedom as well to get to some other trails far from the main killarney entrance",

        "I think your route is fine, but I do think you will need to hire a car for it.\n\nThere is a train line to everywhere on your route except Donegal. I think the train is about double the price of the bus, but you can sometimes get lucky online with cheap fares. You can take the public buses (bus eireann) around the cities and to the countryside but they tend to stop at every stop so the journey can be very long. Some private companies are express so they are quicker and are still quite reasonable. Go bus and Citylink are examples that go to Galway and other cities, but they only go back and forth between Dublin. It\u2019s about 30e return from Dublin to Galway. \n\nIf you do hire a car, I would just be aware that a lot of roads in the countryside are quite windy and narrow and don\u2019t have streetlights. Especially in Donegal! Always add an hour or two to your driving time for stops for food and for getting used to the road conditions. It rains a lot here and that can slow you down when driving too.\n\nWether or not the train is worth it depends; If you are using Cirylink or Gobus I don\u2019t think so as the buses are quite comfortable and take the same amount of time. If you are time constrained I would use the train over bus Eireann.\n\nAny time I have done a road trip like this, it has always been in a car. It\u2019s more reliable, flexible and comfortable in my opinion! If you have any more questions let me know :)",

Some of them stop off at Lahinch or Doolin, which are both lovely, and the Burren. Back to Galway and stay the night again and then do another tour of Connemara and Kylemore Abbey if you feel like a dose of scenery.

Even in Dublin I believe you could find a place less expensive than that, though it might be difficult to do so. Are you eager to continue living in the countryside? Or would you rather move to one of our cities/suburbs? Many of our cities are very small, the second largest city in the country has a population of 500,000. \n\nAs for question 4, extending shouldn\u2019t be an issue, I know a lot of people who have done so, and nobody was rejected, but a word to the wise, our immigration department is remarkably inefficient, they take a long time to process anything.\n\n5: It is very easy to purchase a used bike.\nCheck out donedeal.ie \n\n6: No shortage of either one here!

Although I am considering renting a car... just haven't looked into details yet. Kinda wish I could just bike out of the airport!",
        "Yes we are! I contacted the owners of the hotel and asked them for suggestions and they said we could rent electric bikes. The only thing I\u2019m concerned about is that the peninsula is very narrow and riding bikes on that trial with cars and buses going by doesn\u2019t seem that safe.",
        "Also not sure electric bikes are actually legal here...which could invalidate any travel insurance",
        "Do not rent a car for Dublin city. It is a PAIN. The city centre is a snarl of one-way street systems and new tram lines, you are WAY faster using said trams or buses or the rent-a-bikes or just simply walking, and this is even BEFORE we get into the extortion-fest that is parking in the city centre. Seriously DO NOT RENT A CAR FOR DUBLIN CITY. For places like Newgrange and Glendalough and Powerscourt, you can join tours. \n\nGalway is smaller and a bit easier to manage by car, but make sure that where you are staying has its own parking, again extortionate parking costs on the street. Way easier to get around the city on foot or bike. The added advantage of Galway is that the main railway station is right in the centre by Eyre Square, which makes taking the train from Dublin (Heuston Station) a breeze, and trains can be booked on line in advance (but read the T&Cs to be clear). Again, you can join coach tours for excurions into Clare for the Burren and the Cliffs of Moher or into County Galway for Connemara. But you could also just pick up your car from the airport when you're leaving Dublin, or else rent in Galway city. \n\nIf you are renting, check to see if you are old enough - apparently there IS a lower age limit for car rental in Ireland - and also check if you can transfer your own car insurance policy to cover the rental car, which will significantly reduce the cost to you. You will also save if you're comfortable using a manual transmission car, as automatics are in short supply and high demand. And very important, when picking up the car, walk around it with the agent and make sure they note down all the dents and scratches that are already there, and take footage on your phone if you like too - and of course photos of the car from every angle. Make sure there IS a spare wheel in the back that's in good order, someone I know got caught out by that with a rental. And bring plenty of money as petrol is a bit more expensive than it is over your way. And one last thing regarding the car: go on YouTube and look up videos of how to handle roundabouts. Ireland has lots of roundabouts.",
        "You might want to do a combination. We traveled in May for 2 weeks. Flew into Dublin and took the train (it was fun) to Galway. \n\nSpent 1st day in the city\n\nSpent 2nd day renting a car and driving to Cliff\u2019s of Moher. We made a bunch of stops along the way. I planned a route that took us to a castle, abounded abbey, caves, and The Burren. It was a long day, but so much fun! \n\nThe best part about driving is stopping along the way when something catches your eye. Cute little town? Stop! Random chocolate and cheese shop? Stop! Random ruined church and graveyard? Stop! \n\nMy personal advise is to not drive back after dark. The roads are small with no streetlights so it was a little nerve racking. We also paid more for an automatic and all the insurances. It gave me a nice piece of mind.\n\nWe took the train back to Dublin.\n\nMaybe pick 2 or 3 days where you just drive and then do public transportation the rest. It\u2019s really fun driving through the beautiful countryside.",
        "My wife and I spent two weeks in Ireland going cross-country from Dublin to Galway over the course of the time we were there. I'm not sure where your home country is (I'm in the usa), but the Irish public transport system is amazing. We did extensive research on rental cars beforehand and decided to go with public transport for everything. Best decision we made! There is a train that goes from Dublin right through the middle of the country to Galway , which is not only cheap but fun to ride. We would get off the train wherever we wanted and use buses to get around at each stop . We saved literally hundreds of dollars compared to the price of renting a car for 2 weeks. Especially in the major cities like Dublin and Galway, a bus stops at every bus stop literally every 10 to 15 minutes. So you don't even lose a lot of time waiting for public transport pick up. Even for the places we wanted to go that weren't near the train stops, there were Charter style buses that took us to the northern and southern areas of Ireland. We had just as much freedom of transport as we would have with a rental car, without the worry of finding places to park or taking care of the car, or gas, etc... we were able to quickly and easily get anywhere we wanted to go in the country and save a ton of money and stress doing so. Public transportation all the way!",
        "I would suggest, as a few others have, that you should do a combination. Don't even think of driving a car in Dublin but personally, I would describe the transport system around the rest of the country as inadequate.\nWithin Dublin, I am sure you'd be able to get daily tickets or single journey tickets for your individual trips.\nTwo sites I would suggest you check out are gocar.ie, for short term rentals. I have never used it myself but in principal it sound like it might be of interest to you.\nThe second is the Transport for Ireland Journey Planner app. As an Irlsih person who uses public transport a lot, I would say it is literally the only thing related to public transport in Ireland which can be relied on. Use it before you start your journey to check out possible trip prices and durations and use it when you are here to get around.\nYou should check out whether buying a Leap card will be worthwhile for you too.\n\n...and has anyone mentioned that you bring at least a light raincoat with you?\n\nEnjoy your trip!",
        "I wouldn't drive in Dublin, but as a galwegian a lot of the cool stuff about the county is relatively accessible through bus tours (out to Leenaun and Kylemore Abbey, Clifden, Connemara etc) however if you want to do it at your own pace, a car isn't a bad idea especially to do things like climb Diamond Hill in letterfrack (the view up there is amazing) or heading out to places like Roundstone. The Aran Islands is a cool visit too, as it has the old Irish charm. No cars on the island except for one's owned by locals and the ferry is pedestrians only, you can rent bikes though to go up to Dun Aengus, the ancient settlement fort on the other side of the island to the \"town\". \n\nAlso Go Bus is slightly cheaper for bus tickets and offers pretty much the same service to the same place, but busing it from Dublin to Galway is the best job.",
        "That\u2019s so helpful, thank you! Yeah just the idea of getting past Dublin (let alone through it) in a car gives me anxiety. Definitely leaning toward renting for a few days in Galway and then using buses/train/tours for the rest. We are both comfortable with manual and roundabouts (even though no one in California\u2014where we live\u2014seems to understand how they work), but we will definitely look up roundabouts on YouTube. I imagine doing everything on the left will be a bit disorienting at first so a good visual ahead of time will help. Thank you again for all the advice!",
        "u/ChaChiCoal Sounds like a fun trip! My experience driving on the left side of the road is that it is exhausting. In the US (and Canada too I assume) most roads are interstates or highways where you drive 20-30 minutes in a fairly direct route. In the UK and Ireland, there's no grid of roads -- it's a crazy spider web of roads that requires lots of navigation. Having a nervous 2nd person in the car just adds to the stress (I speak from experience.) \n\n  \nI'm not trying to deter you from getting a car. Please rent a car! It's the best way to see everything! However, I'd recommend zeroing in on one specific area of the country (maybe 2 hour driving radius?) and taking public transportation (bus, train, etc) to that spot. Jet lag is brutal and so are rainy weather conditions. My experience is that you can get better deals on rental cars in the smaller cities.",

Keep this in mind about driving, who\u2019s ever actually driving will miss a lot of scenery because they will need t to keep their eyes on the narrow road while adjusting the brain to driving on the opposite side of road, road signs that will look foreign, possibly standard transmission car and high insurance costs.  I saw people drive the wrong way while there.  Hell it took me a week before I adjusted to crossing the street and turning my head the right direction.    Maybe you do not stress easily so you would enjoy the challenges of driving but for me it was worth not having to drive.",
        "These were definitely our concerns when considering driving verses public transportation. For the most part, we get advice that it takes a little but you get used to it and I think the flexibility of having a car may be best for us. We're still considering for those reasons though!",

        "Hi, we just spent 12 days there on public transportation. We only did Dublin and Galway, but I can give you some tips. Book your train tickets online, and you'll get a discount. Write down your reservation number after you book. When you go to the train station, go to a ticket machine, enter the number, and print your tickets. This saves us some good money on tickets. \nAlso, buy a LEAP card for the buses, sold at most convenience stores like Spar, Centra, Gala, etc. This gets you 30% off the fare. Download the LEAP top up app so you can check the balance and add more money as needed. \nDownload Moovit app, which will give you details on which bus or train to take to wherever you want to go. \nGalway is wonderful! Go to Eyre Square on the bus and walk down the Latin Quarter, check out castles along the way and also the Spanish Arch. Galway is very walkable. You can also pick up souvenirs as you stroll. \nHave a great time! The Irish are fantastic people!\ud83d\ude03\ud83d\ude0a",

Just a personal suggestion though",

For 10 nights with AirBnB (2 in Dublin, 3 in Killarney , 1 in Dingle, 1 in Tralee, 3 in Doolin) we ~~payed~~ paid in total 990\u20ac (445\u20ac per person) and we estimate around 180\u20ac per person for public transport (we took the fares from official site for bus and trains) and 200\u20ac per person for tours and bike\u2019s rent . So in total we\u2019ll spend around 1000\u20ac per person without food and supplies. To hire a car would easily duply this budget. We hope we could return in Ireland in the future and explore all the country with a car, but unfortunately this year we have to do in this way.",

The hotel's you listed for Dublin...I generally wouldn't touch with a barge pole tbh. Sandymount is grand but I'd not base a holiday there. If you want somewhere not too central but near stuff (buses will also get you around, you don't need to be wed to the dart) have a look at the Ballsbridge/Baggot St/ Pembroke Road area. You get the small town aspect like Sandymount but it's not as awkward to get in and out of town.",

You could even do a slight detour near Mitchelstown to Doneraile Court and Wildlife Park if you wished. \n\nDay 2 is ridiculous. Stop. Just go as far as Kenmare, and stop at Ross Castle and Muckross along the way. You could do the walk to the Meeting of the Waters, and then go on to Kenmare, going further is just exhausting and silly. You clearly have no idea what the roads are like in that area. \n\nEither scratch day 3 and the visit to Dingle - seriously, you have NO idea what the roads are like in that area - and just go around the Ring of Kerry and the Staigue fort, etc. and stop for a night before continuing on to your next night, or backtrack to Killarney and go on to Liemrick from there. Or you could drive from Kenmare to Killorglin via the Ballaghbeama Pass. Google it. But don't attempt it if driving tiny narrow roads with a steep drop on one side scares you. \n\nThe more I read this, the more I am sure you are not aware that roads in Ireland are NOT BUILT for the kind of high-speed travel you are used to.

        "I'm not an expert and I'm only visiting ireland for the 2nd time this June. I rented a car last time and I am renting again this time. I have heard that public transport in Ireland (at least trains) is really centered around Dublin. So often you will have to go back to Dublin to get a train elsewhere. This will add time to your plans. Without a car you should be thinkingi ts going to take the majority of a day to travel from one place to the next. I have heard its a 5 hour drive from Dublin to Dingle without stopping. And if you are taking public transport that is probably going to involve a few train/bus changes. So just add that transportation time to your daily plans. Also even driving gets tiring. Are you from the USA? I enjoy driving, but in Ireland even a 1-2 hour drive was exhausting and i felt like it tired me out. I think you would be wise to look into flying to Kerry if you want to start in Dublin.",

You can get a bus from Dunmore into the city (check bus times), and spend a good day wandering around the city. There is a small area called the Viking Triangle with several museums - the Museum of Time, Medieval Museum, Eighteenth Century Museum, Museum of Silver - and a beautiful eighteenth century Anglican cathedral. And an interactive King of the Vikings experience, and Reginald's Tower, a late Viking stone tower. And Waterford Crystal is literally across the road. Between all that and finding some nice restaurants, cafes and pubs to refresh yourself, you'd easily fill the whole day. \n\nYou COULD take a bus to the coast, to Tramore, for example, but it might be a bit tight.\n\nI live in Waterford.

There\u2019s plenty of \u201cTouristy\u201d stuff to see, but unless you\u2019re really into Art, Theater or Museums it can be done in a few hours or a full day. I\u2019d pick like 4 things from the list  below:\n\nNote to others: DONT DRIVE IN DUBLIN. It\u2019s a waste of time/money/frustration. Parking is expensive, traffic is terrible. Just either take the bus around Dublin, buy a \u201chop on\u201d tour pass, or rent one of the MANY e-bikes. I use \u201cBleeper\u201d as I don\u2019t think they require a deposit.\n\n- Trinity College and the Long Room/Book of Kells\n- Gravediggers or the Blue Light & Johnny Foxes\n- Guinness Brewery\n- Dead Zoo\n- National Gallery\n- Chester Beaty \n- SKIP JAMESON, opt for Teeling instead\n- Wax Museum (?)\n- There are a few hikes around Dublin, but you need a car to get there.\n- Stephen\u2019s Green\n- The Dublin Zoo\n\n\nI\u2019d stop in Galway for a night instead. Doolan literally has 4 bars and couple of fancy restaurants and a camp ground. Unless you have a place booked for Glamping, it\u2019s not worth staying. (If you\u2019re booked at Soolan Glamping, it\u2019s awesome for a night).\n\n\nEdit 2: Galway traffic sucks as well during rush-hours. Don\u2019t drive around the time people either go to or get off work. Galway is walkable/bikeable.\n\n\nDublin is expensive. Food, drink.. hotels\u2026 you can get a better value staying in another town.\n\nIf you can figure out a way to go to Wicklow via Rome to Rio or something- it is beautiful, though. But that\u2019s a day trip.\n\n\nDoolan:\n\nYou can take a ferry from Doolan to the Aran islands OR you can take a ferry from Galway to the Aran islands. \n\nDoolan Cave is pretty cool, but \u201csmaller\u201d than other caves if you\u2019ve been to any in America. Check out the Falconry though.\n\n\nGalway:\n\nGalway is one of the cultural centers of Ireland. Plenty of bars, a distillery, and a couple breweries. A good Museum and plenty of random festivals. Good for people watching or just running around town. Everyone who comes to Galway likes it. You can take a bus or rent a \u201cGo Car\u201d for a day rate if you want to drive to Doolan or the Cliffs. Be sure to jump off Blackrock in Salthil.\n\n\nIf you do opt to drive to the Cliffs- skip the lame Cliffs Visiter center and walk along the south west side of the cliffs (left of the visitor center). You can park at a little house on down towards the abandon ruin- just google \u201cCliffs of Moher private car park\u201d.\n\n\nSource: I\u2019m an American who works in Dublin, lives in Galway and have hosted dozen or so friends on different trips from America.\n\n\n\nGalway also has a lot of Michelin guide or even a few Michelin starred restaurants. Good food there!\n\n\nEdit 3: saw you\u2019re coming from Shannon instead of the other way from Dublin to Galway. Doolan may make a little more sense as you said for your first night. BUT I\u2019d still stay a night after in Galway.",
        "Three nights in Dublin is too much. Dublin is the most expensive place in Ireland, and unless you're looking to visit a lot of museums, I just don't understand spending the majority of the time in Dublin. Spend more time in the Galway area. Take a day trip out to Inisheer from Doolin. See if you can book a Connemara bus tour from Galway for a day.\n\nA train from Galway to Dublin is usually around 2 hours of travel time (depending on which time you take it - some have more stops than others), so getting from Galway to Dublin by public transport is really not a problem. If you have an evening flight leaving Dublin, you could easily take a morning train from Galway to Dublin and get to the airport in enough time and not have to pay the extra cost of staying in Dublin for the night.",
        "I suggest renting a car if you\u2019re here for a while, not only because public transport isn\u2019t great but because of the freedom it\u2019ll afford you. Two absolutely stunning drives you should do are in the west of the country; the gap of dunloe in county Kerry (i did it myself a week or so ago for the first time since I was a child and it\u2019s actually really spectacular). The second is the drive in county Mayo from Luisburgh to Lenaun. Equally stunning but quite different. If you\u2019re staying east in Dublin then you should also drive through the Sally Gap in the Wicklow mountains. No need to rent a car for that. There are plenty of bus tours.",
        "I\u2019m going to say, pick one area, be it Donegal, Sligo, Galway, Cork, wherever, and spend 4, 5, all 10 days there. Take a deep dive into the little villages. Wander the streets. Pop into a shop, tavern or cafe. Listen to the music. Take that boat ride. Stay out late. Tour the distillery or brewery. Talk to the people, they are so nice. Go into that castle or museum. Imagine what it was like in the 50\u2019s. The 1650\u2019s! Hike the trails. Stop at the WAW turnouts. Soak in all the ambience of that one area. \n\nThere is so much rich culture and history and beauty. It is difficult to let the opportunity to see it slide by because you\u2019re rushing to the \u201cnext place\u201d.\n\nEdit: then start making return trip plans for areas you didn\u2019t go to this time.",

Intercity buses here lock off their loos, there's no toilet facilities on them, so if that's an issue for you on a 3 or 4 hr ride, than that's something to consider and shrinks your pool of places to get to because you'll need trains...and so on",

If you are in Cork, you can get a train to Cobh, but I'm not sure the Titanic Museum will be open. I'd seriously recommend checking out those venues before making too many plans. Ditto with those tours.\n\nI think four venues is too ambitious. Three would be doable",

        "I checked into the 555 but couldn't find info.  The private company who run it have no timetable on their website but you email them for more details.  info@dualway.com.\n\nUsing public transport, I would get to Galway (bus or train) and then get the 350 to the cliffs.",
        "I would take a Paddy Wagon. Much more comfortable and reliable. I was on one of the regular buses recently that stopped at the cliffs. I was just passing through on my way elsewhere so didn't get off. Neither did 90% of the other passengers. The driver could only let like 4 people on to leave the cliffs. There was a huge line of tired looking disappointed people. I'd want to avoid that!",
        "How are you planning  to get around? By car or public transport?",
        "Aran Islands! Specifically Inis Mor. You can take a round trip ferry for 24 euro, but the pro move is to fly there - Aer Arann round trip airfare is 46 euro. Best part is you beat the ferry (98% of tourists take the ferry) by about 2 hours, so you'll essentially have the island to yourself for that time. Rent bikes, bike to Dun Aengus first, it's the most popular site on the island. See the Wormhole (look it up). \n\nBeautiful island and even more beautiful when you beat the tourists and have the views to yourself.",
        "A car would definitely be better, especially  if you're interested in scenery. I would look into the Wild Atlantic Way route from Kerry to Galway. Get public transport to Kerry, rent a car there and do the ring of Kerry, and then make your way up to Galway stopping in places like Adare, Lahinch and Doolin and seeing the Cliffs along the way. From Galway  you can explore Connemara. You could leave the car in Galway and get public transport to Dublin then. Along the way from Kerry to Galway, there's lots if scenery and traditional pubs. Check out The Crane Bar and Tig Choili in Galway city if you're interested in trad music  sessions.",
        "Hi! I'm Irish so in my opinion, it would really be best to drive, public transport is not great in rural Ireland! I'm sure group tours are ok but you'll mostly see the big tourist attractions with the nature/countryside part just being incidental. \nThere's so many beautiful natural places to visit (not to mention the lovely scenery as you drive from place to place!) that I don't think you would ever see unless you drive yourself, so I really think if you're going to holiday in Ireland for scenery, then driving is imperative!\nAs for destinations... well really the entire coast needs visiting! But in particular, I love the northwest coast: Donegal, Mayo, Sligo for rugged seaside beauty, and you absolutely have to visit Inis Mor (the Aran Islands largest island) which you can get to from Galway. \nThen down south, Kerry and West Cork are beautiful but more quaint and slightly less rugged. \nInland, Tipperary has beautifully green, rich land and you have The Rock of Cashel which is stunning and then Wicklow is really picturesque and natural too.\nI holidayed in Ireland many times and still haven't seen everything, and still feel blown away by the beauty so make the most of your holiday by planning a great route and seeing all you can! You won't be sorry!",
        "This is a huge topic, so I'll try to give as many considerations as I can. Hopefully, you will find something of use.\n\nFirst, for the kind of things you are looking for (wild nature, off the beaten path adventures, rarely visited archaeological sites) I would highly recommend both Beara, Kerry and Dingle Peninsula, and, to a lesser extend Sheep's Head peninsula. All in South-West Ireland, in counties Kerry and Cork. I especially would recommend Beara peninsula and Kerry peninsula (a.k.a the Iveragh Peninsula). The combination of really isolated nature, small towns which are perfect for striking out for multiple one-day trips, good staying facilities and the feeling that you are truly at the edge of Europe, is unparalleled to the rest of the country. I'm biased because I live here, but I do live here for all of the above reasons.\n\nWhat you are trying to do, can be done with some small tour operators, but honestly, I would recommend hiring a car, doing your own research and striking out on your own. Yes, this will take some planning, but when you finally do a hiking trail you have read about online, or find a stone circle you've only seen pictures of, and you are the only one around and have the whole place to yourself... it is an experience you will never forget.\n\nFlying in on Shannon, Cork or Dublin doesn't really matter. You can get to bigger towns with busses and trains easy enough. But from there, getting to smaller towns, especially outside of tourist season with public transport is difficult. I cannot stress this enough. Although there are some connections, if you come from a place where every little place has a public transport connection, that is not what is going on in Ireland. Especially in the wintertime, smaller towns have such restricted connections, that I would not build a schedule around it. Fantastic if a bus goes, but don't count on it to make an important connection. For the places that you want to go to, yes, Shannon would be better than Dublin. Although Wicklow is beautiful (in that case, fly on Dublin), the really wild and abandoned nature can be found out West.\n\nOnce you are here, I highly, highly recommend that you get a rental car. It is by far the best way to see those off the beaten path places. If that is not possible, consider the following options. Know which sites or places you want to visit and hire a cab locally to drop you off and pick you back up again once you have had your expedition. Nearly all towns have local taxi services that you can find online. This can get expensive, but if you are wanting to have these kinds of adventures, and hiring a car is not an option, then this would be an alternative.\n\nLastly, consider hiring bikes. This is not an ideal solution but can work in a pinch. Most small towns have a bycicle rental place (look up if your destination has them) where you can hire bikes for multiple days. This will give you more freedom to move about or explore sites within reach. Do make sure that you hire helmets and reflective vests though. On the country back roads, there are no biking lanes, and locals are not too accustomed to seeing cyclists on the roads. This is getting better though.\n\nFinally, places to stay to strike out from. For Kerry peninsula: Killarney, Kenmare, Waterville, Cahersiveen. For Beara peninsula: Kenmare, Glengarriff, Castletown-Bere.\n\nIf you do decide and go to Beara, one forgotten place that you often have completely to yourself (especially outside of tourist season) are the Cashelkeelty Stone Circles. If you are interested, I did a video about them, here:\n\n[https://youtu.be/7E8zScthaQM](https://youtu.be/7E8zScthaQM)\n\nHope that was helpful!\n\nNiels",
        "We can, but a bit anxious about doing so since the roads are opposite of what we are used to.   We both drive a stick shift, so that part isn't an issue.   If there is a way to use public transportation to at least some places, that would be beneficial.",
        "For where you'd want to be public transport isn't the best so it would either be guided tour (no freedom) or a little nervey for a day or two self driving (all the freedom)",
        "If you're not coming for the city life specifically, look at Wicklow but it's the start of tourism season so the prices are the prices. \n\nYeah you can do Belfast from Dublin via public transport, cheap enough too.\n\nThere is no hard border on the island of Ireland, you'd have to double check with the NI authorities website on visa stuff but you should be fine tbh.\n\nCovid restrictions are all basically gone now. What the airlines might require are on them individually. Even on public transport here the wearing of face masks is advisory.",
        "IMO You're going to spend too much of your vacation time on logistics with the state of public transport. 3 weeks for 1400 is a good deal.",
        "We are 2 people and are just ending our stay in Ireland, 11 days. Renting a car was just not in the budget. So, it was public transportation all the way! In Dublin, you can buy a visitor LEAP card that allows unlimited rides, for a certain number of days. We used way more than what we paid; because it covers rides on the city buses, as well as the DART train, which takes you out to the villages. We took St Kevin's bus out to Wicklow National Park. We took Gobus to Galway, a lovely ride. We took a train to Athenry, an amazing medieval village.  The advantage of public transportation is you really interact with locals and experience local culture.  There are regional buses and day tours that go practically everywhere. In total we paid a total of $245 for transportation versus $1500 plus gas at $8 per gallon, and we saw a ton. This also gave us more money to eat the local food, pay admission prices here and there, and take a couple of great day tours. We downloaded Moovit app and it gives you details on what bus or train to take. So, just make a budget and you will have a great time, with or without a car.",
        "You haven't factored in the cost of petrol yet. I think taking public transport, booking group bus tours etc. will be fine - you just need to plan things a little more than you would if you hired a car (book things in advance, etc.)",
        "\ud83d\ude03 I hope you really enjoy yourselves! Kids also travel really cheaply on the buses and trains! CityLink and Gobus are wonderful for going city to city. Gobus was awesome, with toilets and wifi on board, and they load your luggage underneath so you don't have to haul it around. The train was also very scenic and comfortable. We absolutely loved Irish public transport!  Save us much as you can so you have plenty for the next vacation!",
        "99.9% of things are closed on Christmas day. Pubs, by law, everything else because public transport shuts down for the day. You'll either have to cook for yourself or try book into one of the very few restaurants that open.",
        "Honestly, it's not a great time to visit if you want to do the typical tourist thing. Many outdoor sites close for the winter anyway. \n\nHere's my suggestion: stay in one of the cities, maybe NOT Dublin as it's so expensive, but Galway or Kilkenny or Cork, and arrange to eat in a hotel on Christmas Day - you would have to book ahead NOW as many places will be booked up. Plan to have your dinner in the late afternoon, and if you're in Dublin, in the morning you can do any of the following: walk around the city centre and admire the buildings; take public transport (the DART) to Howth or Bray and walk around the headlands there, or just to Dun Laoghaire and walk the pier. \n\nI think the sales will start on the 26th December so there will be more people around the city centre then, and pubs and that will be open so you'll have more options for food and things to do in the evening. Regarding the tours you want to do, you'd be as well to contact the tour company directly about the dates you want to go on.",
        "I am not really worrying about eating (I can cook something/grab a couple of sandwiches the day before), but about \"what to do\" as I won't be able to go anywhere because of public public transport not working on Christmas",
        "> but about \"what to do\" as I won't be able to go anywhere because of public public transport not working on Christmas\n\nWalk around the town - it'd be the best time cos it'll be quiet.\n\nThe parks will be open, take a stroll around Stephen's Green, Phoenix Park, etc., walk along the canal...",
        "That's pretty comprehensive. I won't asked what possessed you to go to such bother but just say thank you hctet. \n\nI will ask you to add a link to www.wexfordbus.ie too to your post. If you are travelling between Wexford and Dublin City or Dublin Airport it may suit a traveller to use this bus as it runs at times that Bus Eireann may not. It's also cheaper than the train to Dublin and Bud Eireann to Dublin City or Airport. It also services Rosslare Europort (boats to the UK or France) during the day also."
