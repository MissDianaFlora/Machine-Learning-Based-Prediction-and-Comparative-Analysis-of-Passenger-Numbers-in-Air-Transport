Experiences using Public transport in Ireland,"I’ve seen a lot of posts on this Reddit about how public transport in Ireland is terrible and not worth considering when travelling around the country. Sure there are gaps in coverage and now and again the bus in particular just randomly doesn’t turn up or is already full or late ( mainly because the operators are having difficulties recruiting).

Thought I’d start a thread here where locals and visitors could share their experiences. I have used intercity Irish rail, Dublin Bus , Luas and Dart extensively but have only limited experience using Bus Eireann. 

Overall,  it’s not terrible in my experience, far from it. 

Irish rail is great value and reasonably priced for long distance travel. Transport in Dublin is fine- the 90 minute fixed fare is super though obviously what we have doesn’t compare to larger cities like London in the reach and frequency. As a result the city can be congested though it impacts on all modes of transport especially buses and cars, the impact is less so on Luas and not at all on the dart.
You can make a reasonable argument that the buses and trains should have a lot more coverage and greater frequency but for the rail network what is there works really well, is fast, comfortable and for longer journeys is excellent value. As a for instance, the  train from Dublin to Galway booked online is €15 on a very comfortable train with a free seat reservation included. I think that’s good value for a c. 200km, 2.5 hour journey and compares well to other countries. I’ve paid far more in the UK for similar journeys. The petrol and motorway tolls to do that drive would cost you significantly more even driving a car you already own never mind having to hire one.

Among local users the satisfaction surveys are pretty good- see here https://www.transportforireland.ie/news/nta-publishes-results-of-customer-satisfaction-survey/

And stats around reliability https://www.irishrail.ie/en-ie/about-us/train-punctuality-reliability-performance

Can we get a more balanced and objective view to help visitors out?

Edit: There is some great real world feedback below- consensus I think that Irish rail is grand, if sometimes crowded and getting around Dublin by public transport is also pretty ok (with the acknowledged lunacy that you can’t reach the Airport other than by bus or taxi) but a lot of frustration with rural and intercity buses which are unreliable. Driving in Dublin generally won’t make much sense to those unfamiliar with the city, it’s fairly congested, parking is expensive and you’ll find it easier to get around the city centre where most of the sites are on foot, cycling or using public transport than trying to drive.

There is also a view that getting to key (scenic) tourist destinations outside the cities like the Cliffs of Moher and Ring of Kerry using public transport is much more problematic- it’s doable but relies on buses and can be slow which may not suit visitors whose time in Ireland may be constrained. A specialist day trip tour will likely suit your needs better. 

Suggestion: 

What would improve the rail system would be making easier to travel between regional cities, too much of the tracks radiate from
Dublin and it’s a palaver with multiple changes to get (say) from Killarney to Galway.

Given Irish rail operate extremely expensive tourist rail tours there may also be an argument for more focus on scheduled tourist oriented routes and expanding the bus network around tourist locations. 
As someone once said, build it and they will come.

Planning a journey

Transport for Ireland is the national regulatory authority for public transportation (as well as taxis and cycling) and has a good journey planner here.

 (Google maps is often good also)

Long distance trains

Buy and and plan intercity train journeys on https://www.irishrail.ie/en-ie/. Best prices available online and fares are the same price at all times, varying slightly for the amount of flexibility you want usually ok to buy a day or so in advance but may be booked out at very busy times. Some routes can be busy so reserve seat in advance when booking online.

You get a code back by email and then collect your ticket in the machine in the station. You can opt to display your name or a reservation number over the seat in the carriage which will indicate its taken (not always observed but people will usually move when asked- generally Irish people are polite travellers but occasionally can be a bit raucous when in large groups say travelling to a stag do or a sporting occasion). You are not permitted to consume alcohol on board by the way.

But city to city train travel is usually cheaper, handier than driving and you’ll see more on the train. Driving and train times are usually comparable on motorway routes and the train can edge it on routes like Killarney where there’s a decent non motorway leg after Limerick. However, bear in mind the car gets you door to door where you may have local travel to book end your train journey which can slow you down.

Travelling around Dublin.

Arrival in Dublin by Air

Dublin Airport bizarrely is not served by train. Options are taxis (plan on €30 fare depending on traffic to City centre and time of travel) or express coaches. Obviously a taxi may work
out cost effective for a group of 4.

If you’re on a tight budget Dublin airport is also served by local buses 41 and 16 which are pretty regular (41 runs 24 hours) if you buy a regular leap card (see below) in the airport before you leave it’s a €2 fare into the city centre, slightly more if paying cash and no change given of notes or credit/ debit cards accepted as of now (work
underway on this but it’s at least a year away). 

However 16/41 are not a tourist bus and therefore luggage space will be limited so if you’re hawking a large 20kg suitcase an
express bus will better serve your needs.

There are also a range of long distance coaches serving other regional cities from the airport, some
direct and bypassing Dublin City.

See https://www.dublinairport.com/to-from-the-airport/by-bus

Getting around Dublin

Dublin has three modes of public transport (all accept leap cards) as well as the Dublin Bike scheme which is very popular but limited to the inner city area.

There are also specialist tourist oriented city tour buses which allow you to hop on/off and have guide commentary. Heavily promoted in the city centre ( say on Dame Street in front of Trinity) and it’s unlikely you won’t see them.

Walking tours are also very popular- look on trip advisor for the highest rated ones- usually provided by knowledgeable and humorous local guides.

Ticketing in Dublin public transport

It’s not necessary/ possible to buy commuter bus, tram or local train journeys in advance. All can be crowded during rush commuter hour but you’ll still get on (usually) though you might need to stand. As in any city at busy times pay attention to your luggage and be vigilant for pickpockets which are not unknown.

Buy bus tickets from the driver (you can pay with coins or notes but you won’t get change), you can pay for Luas or train tickets which are sold in machines at each Luas stop or train station. You can pay for Luas and train tickets using credit or debit cards but buses are cash only or tag on instead of buying a ticket using your leap card -

See below section on leap cards (both commuter and visitor )  for a convenient and low hassle approach to paying fares below. 

City buses - generally ok but not super easy to figure out the routes/ stops- use the TFI route planner or see https://www.dublinbus.ie/home.
Frequency is less good outside of peak times and the buses themselves are a mixture of new and old buses with some fairly shabby vehicles still in service (but bear in mind most journeys are short and they work ok as a means of getting to the many places not covered by Luas and Dart.

Tram is called the Luas and has two lines both of which traverse the city centre. Green line goes from Broombridge in Cabra on the Northside to Brides Glen in the south suburbs. 

The red line goes from the 3arena in the docklands to Saggart and Tallaght in the south west suburbs. 

Off the top of my head I can’t think of much tourist destinations on the Green line but the red line serves the National
Museum, Heuston (main intercity train station) as well as Kilmainham gaol. Guinness Storehouse/ brewery isn’t too far from Heuston stop either.

See map https://luas.ie/assets/files/Luas_Map.pdf

Commuter trains in Dublin are the Dart (running along Dublin Bay coast from
Malahide and Howth in the North to Bray and Greystones in the south and the southern part is a very picturesque trip along an historic railway line https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin_and_Kingstown_Railway?wprov=sfti1) and Arrow serving commuter suburbs to the west of the city.

Dublin BIke Scheme

These are literally everywhere in the city centre and there are plenty of bikes available across the network of bike stations 

1 day pass costs €3.50, €5 for
3 days 

They’ve added these short passes to the mobile app way of unlocking a bike which is the handiest
Once you’ve bought a pass most journeys are free (you only pay for journeys lasting more than 30 mins and Dublin is pretty compact and flat) see https://www.dublinbikes.ie/en/home

Student/Young person travel 

International students (as well as locals) studying full time can apply for a student leap card https://about.leapcard.ie/young-adult-and-student-card-launch which gives a 50% discount on travel. A similar young adult card (no requirement to be a full time student) isavailable also and soon to be extended (early 2024) to those aged 19 to 25. Discounts for student/YA cards apply to all fares nationwide not just those in the Dublin leap card ( commuter/ short hop) zone.

Leap Travel cards
There is a visitor leap card available which gives unlimited travel in the Dublin region at fixed prices

1 day (24 hours) – €8.00
3 days (72 hours) – €16.00
7 days (168 hours) – €32.00

These prices are less than the daily caps for regular leap cards so if you’re doing a lot of journeys they work out good value and you don’t have to worry about running out of credit. 

A regular (non visitor)  leap card costs €5 and it makes most sense if you’re only taking a few journeys which will be the case for many visitors as Dublin is compact enough to explore the city centre on foot.  if you’re spending a few days in Dublin the regular card may work out cheaper than a visitor card for light use. Leap card credit can be topped up in rail stations or using mobile app. 

Main advantages of leap cards are not having to worry about coins on buses which dont take credit cards and don’t give change of notes, flat €2 fare for 90 minute unlimited travel across multiple modes of transport and
discounts on the cash fare.  

Both types of regular/ visitor leap cards can be bought in the ticket machines in train stations and many retail agents https://about.leapcard.ie/about/where-to-buy

But you need to visit a specialist Student Leap agent to buy a student or young adult card as these require you to prove eligibility and have a photo taken.","I use public transport quite a lot and it doesn't tend to let me down too much. I think if you are prepared to do a bit of research and adjust your plans then you can have an okay experience, but really we shouldn't be at a point where that has to happen. The government and transport companies look at passenger numbers and think it is as high as can be be, rather than realising that there's a ton of people out there who would use it if they didn't have to wait two hours between services. The same problem is the reason they don't replace connections through the capital with direct services: sure people don't go from Cork to Sligo now, so why bother? It's this attitude that needs to change at all levels of power, otherwise we will be three decades down the road and Dublin will still dominate the country with all the current issues that it brings. Getting any form of public transport between cities is always going to be cheaper than the car, but the car drops you at your house not in a windswept station with no facilities and relying on a connecting service to finish your journey.

Irish Rail is very cheap compared to the UK, the problem is simply one of capacity and frequency. Things like staff, engine and driver numbers will always impose an upper ceiling on things but Irish Rail doesn't seem prepared to ramp up train numbers to bring in any latent demand. They think that the 9pm train being quiet is a reason not to put on an 11pm one, rather than realising that people are simply driving because there's no other option.

The intercity coaches are a good fallback if you need to get somewhere later at night, but my experience of these is solely travelling between Dublin and another city. You might get lucky if you happen to be on the end of a spur, so Limerick to Ennis or Cork to Tralee, or somewhere on the way, like Kildare village, but outside of that you are screwed. That said, I find the intercities are reliable and cheap, but as somebody else said, interacting with the driver on a basic question can drastically change your opinion. I don't know if it's because some services are government-run or because there is a driver shortage and they can get away with it, but the way some speak to passengers who are being polite and asking sensible questions is shocking. I totally understand that there are plenty of arsehole passengers too, but I actually see less of those compared to drivers kicking off.

In the cities the bus problem for me is that they simply don't run late enough, and then you are in the hands of taxi drivers who are openly turning meters off because they are never inspected. Same problem with the Luas and the Dart, which only cover a minority of the city anyway. Again I find the fares cheap, it's like 1.35 or something in Limerick, but I can imagine having to connect between services is no craic. Also I find the bus drivers seem to be much less unhinged than the coach drivers, although I figured they'd have much more reason to hate every passenger they see.

For my pipe dream, I'd have every city north and south connected by a direct service, as well as every university, port and airport. I'd have most of the arterial carriageways and all circular routes in Dublin, Cork, Belfast, Limerick, Derry and Galway have a tramline in the bus lane. Dublin has already re-designed the bus network based on this system. Any major European city, and most of the smaller ones, have this system. Lisbon had a massive tram network right across the oldest parts of town where routes wind around tiny hillside streets, the particular trams are smaller in those parts but even Porto, Prague, Cologne, Milan and Stockholm all have this. I've never used the rental bikes and scooters as I have my own and live in a small city, but I see plenty of young people and loads of tourists using them, probably a good alternative to ramming a bike into a one-bedroom apartment. I'd also personally collect and bury every single Leap card at the bottom of the sea and replace it with a contactless system that is seamless between services, meaning you get off a bus and onto a bike within 90 minutes and it is a single charge. 

We have to be serious about climate change but even if you don't give a shit about that, these are all things that exist in plenty of other places that we like to group ourselves into, and plenty of others we don't. For a small country with no major environmental challenges of freak weather events to contend with, as well as a massive budget surplus to spend, we should have a significant headstart on most other places, but we're crippled by parochialism, short-termism and a lack of strategic thinking. There's finally work being done on a rail link between Limerick and Foynes, and it only seemed to get over the line because they don't want rich Americans stuck in traffic for the Ryder Cup. The operator at Foynes and the EU was pleading with the government to re-open the line, and when they finally decided to, they forgot to survey the part of the line that goes to the cement factory. We're talking 2 or 3km of track that could take major freight traffic off the road, but as usual everyone thought it was somebody else's problem."
Transportation for a week in Ireland?,"Hello! We have a group of 13 that will be touring Ireland next August. I’m currently leaning toward renting 3 larger vehicles and driving ourselves around but wanted to see what others thought. 

Pros: can go wherever/whenever we want and cost effective

Cons: we are used to driving on the right (Wisconsin) and most of our group have not been to Ireland previously, so they are unaware of what a true narrow road looks like.

Any other suggestions? Good private busses that could accommodate an already planned itinerary (From Dublin to Dingle seeing as much as possible in between)?

Thank you all!!",Thanks for the feedback! I’ll definitely be using my cards insurance (chase sapphire) but we have been duped in the same fashion in the past when getting a rental!
Dublin and Skellig Michael city break,"so I'll surprise my parents with a trip in Ireland- I'd like them to visit Dublin and Skellig Michael on a short trip at the end of May (5-6 days). How doable is this given that they'll probably use public transport? (because of the driving on the left- not sure they'll accommodate that fast to give it a try)

how risky is it to book a landing tour right after the start of the season (around may 20)? are there any weather patterns from previous years worth taking into account? is it best to book on a week day than on a weekend? (maybe fewer people during the week)

what would you recommend to do in the area if the tour gets cancelled, especially if they'll only use public transport? thank you!

On the verge to buy the plane tickets so any advice would be greatly appreciated.","They could hire a private driver-guide if they don't mind spending a bit more. It could be comparable to renting a car anyway. Getting there by publlic transport, as others in this thread have mentioned, will take a bit of planning. Getting to Killarney is fine (doable from Dublin by train or coach bus) but then getting to Portmagee is a little more difficult. They could get a taxi driver from Killarney to bring them, however. If you are on Facebook, join the Ireland on a Budget Travel Planning Tips group but please answer the questions before joining as I am very strict on membership. We have lots of licensed private drivers in the group as well as taxi companies. The weather will definitely play a part in how easy it will be to get to Skellig. At the end of May, it should be fine but you never know with the Irish weather lol. I've written about Skellig on my blog: https://irelandonabudget.com/news/skellig-michael-reopens/"
Ireland Recommendations,"Ireland Recommendations

We are traveling to Ireland with a medium sized group for my sister-in-law’s 30th birthday in April (19-27). We are going to be in Dublin(19-21), Cork(21-22), Dingle(22-24), Galway(24-26), and end again in Dublin(26-27).

Hoping to make public transit work for transport (if we can get the leg between Dingle and Galway to work…looking into a few tour options to take us from one spot to the other with a stop at the Cliffs of Moher)

I would love to hear advice on unique experiences in these places. Input on the typical tourist to-dos is also welcome but I’d love to especially hear about the slightly off the beaten path experiences you’ve had in these locations. We are a group of 6-8 that is down to try about anything.

Additionally, I love to take home souvenirs from trips that are very true to the place I’ve visited. Any recommendations for places to stop in at? I’ve seen so far Claddagh rings in Galway and I remember seeing a few things about wool items.

EDIT:

Would also LOVE recommendations for vintage stores in any of the cities we are stopping in. Another favorite way to bring home memories from a trip for me :-) ","Do you have any prior experience driving in Ireland or on the continent? A group this size, the temptation will be to get a minibus or a large SUV. That will be a mistake if you're not familiar with the roads and villages here. If this is the case, I suggest you don't get anything larger than a VW Tiguan."
Getting around,"Hello all!

Thank you in advance for your answers! I'm looking to travel to Ireland the first two weeks of July and I'm a little stuck.

I'm a great driver but I have not driven on the other side of the street and don't want to risk anyone else's life that's not how I do things.

That being said I know the island is drivable in half a day, would stay in Dublin for those 2 weeks and just adventuring out be a good plan or are there other options?

I've read that within the city there is good transportation but I would like the option just in case I hear of something I would like to see.","The island is NOT driveable within half a day, unless you literally ONLY want to drive on one of the few ""larger"" motorways and miss out on all the sights and things that make Ireland so wonderful. Even still, it'd be impossible to drive the entirety of Ireland in 1/2 a day.

That being said, driving in Ireland is great. If you are a good drive at home, you will not be ""putting other people's lives in danger"" by driving on the left.

Rent the SMALLEST car you can fit you and your bags in, get an automatic so you don't have to think about switching gears and can just focus more on the drive and scenery, make sure you have a good mobile plan for the GPS directions and preferrably a good nagivator/companion to help with the directions, and get out of Dublin as quickly as possible -  no more than 2 MAYBE 3 days.

On your way out of Dublin grab the Rental Car, get the Full Insurance (or as MUCH as you can afford) as most Credit Cards and US based insurance companies will NOT cover your rental specifically in Ireland. And since the roads are narrow and the brambles and brush will be scraping your car sides alot, having the insurance will give you at MINIMUM peace of mind, and at worst case a full coverage if something does happen. (I usually wing it with rental cars, but Ireland is its own special case).

I was there this past July/August for 17 days and this was the route I drove, primarily AVOIDING the large motorways as much as possible to ensure I saw the Irish countryside and I was NOT disappointed. It seemed like every blind turn or hill top lead to some amazing view or ancient ruin that would have been completly missed had I b-lined from points A to B using the few Motorways Ireland has.

But I don’t like spending hours driving everyday. Maybe 2 is ok. Then I want a break. I mostly drove around Clare, Galway and Mayo but then drove one day over to Dublin. I just wouldn’t want to drive that far everyday of my vacation."
Which route (by train/bus) would you fine folks suggest?,"Hi everyone, 

In May '24, my parents (75 yrs) and my husband and I (51 yrs) will be visiting your fine country. This is my parents first time traveling out of the US ever, and my husband's first trip to Ireland.  (I spent five weeks there as an exchange student as a teen... 36 years ago. So, uh, I sort of feel disingenuous saying I have been there before. I have technically, but obviously so much is different. I was in Bray and saw a lot of the east, which I loved dearly, but I also have spent 36 years regretting not getting out west, and I know when my parents think Ireland they're thinking more like Ennis or Galway or Kenmare than they are Dublin... and honestly, I was a lucky brat to get to go and my mom and dad deserve to see nice things and have fun and I want to help with that, because they've been by and large lovely parents).

We have the larger details together. We fly from Boston to Shannon, spending a week in Killarney (taking the coach down... also doing the vast majority of the trip by public transport w/a few private tours to specific sites.) 

Going to take the train from Killarney to Dublin, and while our hotel is in Killiney I don't have qualms about doing the train to LUAS to DART and then either bus/walk or maybe finding a taxi (my parents are in fairly good shape, but none of us have been known for athleticism or coordination, so it's hard to grasp how even minimal luggage might effect things. )

I know Killiney is a bit distant from Dublin,  though not an impossible commute. We have Wednesday and Thursday planned out, and on Friday we head from Dublin ultimately to Ennistymon. My question is this: it seems we have a couple of options for the train cross country.  Would it be more interesting (or aggravating) to go from Dublin to Galway on the train, and take the 350 bus down to Ennistymon? If we stopped in Athenry (that seems to be an option) is there a West Clare type train/coach that could take us to Ennis and we could get a bus to Ennistymon from there? Would the travel from Dublin to Galway on the train look noticeably different landscape feature wise than the train from Dublin to Ennis? 

Since we're going to lose most of the day we travel from home base to home base to plain old travel time, I'd like for that train time to be part of the adventure of it all. I'd also like to have my parents have as less stress as possible (though their requirements seem to be seeing sheep, greenery and rocks, so I think they're going to love it instantly). But if there's a train ride back west that offers something a bit different than the sort of view one sees Killarney to Dublin, even if it is a little longer, that'd kick ass. 

We will be leaving from Shannon as well, so no need to return east again. 

Tl;dr Traveling from Dublin to Ennistymon with elderly parents via train/bus. What transport options do you all think have the best wow/uniqueness factors to make a mundane travel day something special? (And yes, at some point we plan on taking the 350 bus up the Clare coast just because it sounds that beautiful.)

Thanks again, all. I am so excited to come back, and I know my mom and dad are going to love it (forgive them if they are loud... they didn't used to be but *are* in denial about the hearing loss).","Anything we have to be at in a timely fashion (like the flight home) we are definitely planning on having rides to or from booked prior to leaving the US. It was more the availability of taxis in some areas that was a little unnerving... my mom specifically had concerns that maybe we would miss the last shuttle out of the Burren and be stuck somewhere in the countryside (although I don't know if it was all concern. I think she also took a secret thrill, lol). If we have a forty-five minute wait to get the next bus or a cab pick up in the city and there's a pub or a sheltered bench should the rain and wind be doing there thing, that wouldn't be the end of the world. It's also sort of nice that all apps connect to licensed taxi drivers by design there. 

We live in the city, my parents have lived in a rural area in a town with no traffic lights, no cabs and no instacart type delivery services for over 40 years, so I feel like I worry about them excessively and they're tougher than they look (I think the idea of getting on a train or bus is a little more intimidating for them than the physicality of carrying a bag a mile or so, but there's definitely the looking like a target aspect of that that concerns me somewhat)."
Rolling luggage in Dublin and Belfast?,"Hello! I'm super excited to visit Ireland in October. I am American and have never travelled internationally. Americans are generally warned that the ludicrously huge rolling bags are a huge no-go in Europe due to uneven sidewalks, a lack of elevators, never ending steps, etc.

I know packing light is always a must, but I'll need a medium sized checked bag because of the trip length. 

I'm flying into Dublin and will take public transportation to our hotels in the city. We are heading to Belfast on the commuter train for a few days as well. We'll be at three hotels total. 

What do you think: is rolling luggage functional enough for Dublin and Belfast? We're pretty able bodied so that isn't a concern, but I don't want to be annoyed by stone streets or a lack of elevators in metro stations. I also don't really want to purchase a backpack just for this trip and would rather roll to save my legs and back. 

Would love thoughts and experiences!","Are they not just ‘normal’ taxi drivers, under the Uber banner?"

Because it’s actually cheaper to do that (no call-out charge, no “technology fee”). Perhaps it was very different times of day, as rates change for that. I *think* there’s a higher rate on Sundays too.

Also, at busy times some taxi drivers don’t pick up from the apps, as they have to pay up to (I think) 13% to FreeNow. So at busy times, availability might be better by hailing a taxi on the street."

Just Back: Dublin + Belfast 6D5N Trip,"Hello everyone!   
Just got back from a 6D5N trip from Dublin + Belfast and wanted to give an update on how did the trip go. We were two female travelling in from Holyhead, Wales. Ferry ride was amazing and stable. Managed to sleep really well on it too. Here's the breakdown of our trip.

**Saturday**: Arrived in Dublin in the morning, got our rental car, drove to Howth, did the circular trail, saw some amazing sights, had oysters/mussels at Octopussy, drove towards Belfast, stopped at Newcastle Beach to stretch our legs and look at the mountains, drove to Inch Abbey, checked in at Belfast, walked around the marina.

**Sunday**: Went to St George's Market in Belfast, checked out the Botanic Gardens, went to Victoria Square to see the glass dome thingy, took the coastal drive towards Carrick-a-Rede, saw the Dark Hedges (a little underwhelming), and Giant's Causeway, drove towards Derry.

**Monday**: Did a Derry Walking Tour, Free Derry Museum (learnt a lot more about the Troubles), had a really nice lunch at The Badgers, drove towards Galway, saw the colourful houses(?), drove back to Dublin, returned the rental car.

**Tuesday**: Got around Dublin just by foot/public transport from here on out. Saw the book of Kells (prebooked tickets), visited St Patrick's Cathedral (prebooked tickets), Guinness Storehouse (prebooked tickets). Had pizza at Little Pyg and it was really good!

**Wednesday**: Took a bus to Bray, did the Bray Head cliff walk and had really nice pastries at Finnbees Coffee House. Came back to Dublin to shop and had an obscene amount of hot chocolate at Butler's.

**Thursday**: Kilmainham Gaol (prebooked tickets), Phoenix Park, National Museum of Ireland - Decorative Arts & History, St Stephen's Green. Our ferry was at 8:50pm so we had a whole day to explore and shop (and drink more pints). Then we headed back!

Overall, it's a really nice experience! It's our first time in Ireland and we found it really safe to navigate for two young female. People were really nice and helpful and would offer to help us find our bus/Luas whenever they see us looking at maps/information boards. Dublin is really walkable too. Will definitely return with family and friends! Thank you for having us :)","Yes we did 🤣🤣🤣  
My friend wanted to look at the houses she saw on Instagram posts and I wanted to go to Derry after watching Derry Girls so we made sure we fit those two things in. It was a really nice drive though. I drive on the left in my country anyway so it wasn't that big of a change for me."
"Suggestions / Thoughts on an itinerary, please","Hello, my friend & I (35F) are planning a trip to Ireland (and Scotland) for the end of August/beginning of September. 

We need help planning an itinerary. We currently have two ideas and cannot decide what to do. 

Our main issue is we will not have a car. Being from the US, we do not feel comfortable driving in Ireland. 

Idea #1
We will fly into Dublin & spend a few days there. From Dublin, we will go to Galway for a few days (via train) and do a day tour to the Cliffs of Moher. Finally, we will spend a couple of nights at Dromoland Castle. Leave from Shannon Airport. 

Idea #2
We will fly into Dublin & the spend the first part of our trip there. From Dublin, we will go to Dromoland Castle (via train or bus) for the second half of the trip and do a day tour to the Cliffs of Moher. Leave from Shannon Airport. 

I’ve been reading a lot of your tips and many of you have suggested to station in two cities, so we are not sure if we should skip Galway and simply split our time between Dublin and Dromoland.  

Based on your suggestions in other threads, these are some of the things we hope to see/do:

- Dublin Castle
- Christ Church Cathedral 
- St. Patrick’s Cathedral
- Guinness Storehouse
- Trinity College / Book of Kells
- Grafton Street 
- Iveagh Gardens
- St. Stephen’s Green
- Ha’penny Bridge
- Temple Bar district
- EPIC
- Day tour to Glendalough 
- Falconry/Hawk Walk (at Dromoland)

I realize there’s so much more to see, but don’t want to spread ourselves to thin. 

Any suggestions at all (hotels, transportation, restaurants, etc) is welcome & greatly appreciated!","> Our main issue is we will not have a car. Being from the US, we do not feel comfortable driving in Ireland.

Driving here really isn't that difficult. It takes a little time to get used to it, but you'll adapt quickly enough, and once you do then you'll have no trouble at all readjusting to it on future visits. Having a car would give you a lot more freedom to explore, especially if you want to go stay at places outside the cities like Dromoland, as transit outside the cities is fairly infrequent and limited."

"Coming to Ireland with my wife and three kids (16, 16 and 12) next week for 6 nights, is this too much?","Hello all,

I am hoping someone can give me a little feedback on the itinerary I setup for our trip to Ireland next week (yes I know, nothing like waiting until the last minute!).   This will be our first time coming, and while I wish our stay was going to be longer, this is the best we could do.   I rented a car, by the way, so we won't be relying on public transportation.   I am still within the cancellation/change window for my lodging, too, so I can move things around, if necessary.   That being said, does the following itinerary seem feasible?

Day 1, land in Dublin at 5:15a and then drive to Cliffs of Moher (stay in Galway)

Day 2, Connemera, (stay in Galway)

Day 3, drive to Killarney (stay in Killarney)

Day 4, ring of Kerry or Dingle (stay in Killarney)

Day 5, drive to, and stay at, Kinnity Castle

Day 6, drive to Dublin and explore the city (stay in Dublin)

Day 7, airport in the am to fly home.

&#x200B;

I truly appreciate any feedback!

&#x200B;

Edit:

Based on the feedback, I am scrapping the idea of driving to Cliffs on Day 1.   I am also now leaning to just staying in Dublin the first day and driving to Galway on Day 2.   I am also removing Kinnitty from the itinerary as well.   Thank you all for your help with this!    ","That is a crazy itinerary.  

Six days in Ireland during winter with short days and maybe bad weather.

Stay within hour or so of Dublin.  Leave the west of Ireland for another time.  There is no bad part of Ireland, pretty much all of it is beautiful.

My suggestion.  Day 1 and night in Dublin.

Day 2 and 3 in Wicklow.  Spend a night in Glendalough.  That is as beautiful as anywhere in the west.   If weather is cold cold, you may well not be able to get in or out.  So this is very weather dependent.

Day 4 & 5, stay in Kilkenny.  The park, castle, city, etc is really pretty.  

Places like Boyne or Hill of Tara are also really good options.

Driving in Ireland in winter is not fun.  And days are just too short.  Stay close to Dublin ish."

But on straight wide open roads. Driving in Ireland is often on narrow windy roads. It’s exhausting and I enjoy driving. Plus who wants to spend their vacation stuck in a car looking out a window? less is more in Ireland and I think the majority of people will agree with me on that. Driving from Dublin to the Cliffs Then back to Galway after getting off a red eye flight sounds crazy.

The section of road from Galway to the cliffs is very narrow. The last time I went there my bus driver got stuck in a village as there was too much traffic for the bus to turn left. Cue gridlock and delays. On some days it takes me an hour just to cross Galway city as the traffic is so bad. I drive around Galway every day and I’m telling the OP that going from Dublin airport to Cliffs and back to Galway with a car full of exhausted kids and newly driving on a different side of the road is going to spoil the holiday for everyone.
Driving in Ireland. Is it as much of a nightmare as I've heard?,"I've been to Europe before, but have always taken public transportation. I'm looking to visit Ireland next year and am in a panic about driving in a foreign country on the wrong side of the car and road. I've also heard the country roads are very narrow and the locals drive like ""banshees out of hell."" Not my words. 

How fearful should I be? Is my fear unfounded or should I be as freaked as I am? Any suggestions to ease my anxiety about this?",How long have you been driving? Do you know how to drive stick? I just came back from there and I had fun. I opted for an automatic transmission so that I'd have one less thing to worry about. Here's my take on driving in Ireland. In american we have bigger lanes on our streets then ireland an a lot of europe does which is really interesting when you have a bus coming towards you the other direction. The highways are nice and big and they have those raised reflectors on them to help you stay in your lane (I've heard them called road turtles before). But I found most of my driving was done on back roads so be ready for a lot of single lane roads with hedges right up against the freaken road. Honestly I had a great time driving roughly the same parts your going to drive. But Dublin was not as fun. It's a lot if one way streets and certain streets were for buses only during certain times and my GPS didnt know this so I could of easily gotten a ticket. Maybe the cops are use to it so it's not a big deal but I dont know that. The part I couldn't believe was some of the posted speed limits on the country roads were freaking insane. It was posted as 80 km/hr but I was only comfortable doing 60 so dont feel pressured in doing the speed limit cause I saw a lot of locals only doing 60 too. It took me two days to relax into driving so have fun and make sure you have a good navigator with you. Someone who wont stress you out and have fun with it. It's beautiful driving I found.

How fearful should I be? Is my fear unfounded or should I be as freaked as I am? Any suggestions to ease my anxiety about this?","I've driven twice in ireland for extended periods of time. Once in the countryside where the 2 way roads are one narrow lane and once in Dublin downtown.  Like another user, I do suggest edging the left side mirror a little down so you can see the lane markers because it will be inevitable that you will drift. 

Honestly, if you don't drive a stick shift regularly, get an automatic. It will take another thing off your mind while you get used to the rules of the road.

My biggest issue was figuring out the turnabouts because they're going so quick and can get congested. I suggest looking up a video or a visual before attempting to go on the road.  I was lucky enough that a taxi driver gave me a quick rundown of car priority at roundabouts and where to keep my eyes to watch out for cars. Probably the most helpful thing of all.

If you're used to driving in the mountains  then driving in the countryside is pretty similar. Just make sure you don't sideswipe your side mirror on a stone wall. There is definitely less congestion outside the major city ways so you'll have an easier time getting used to being on the opposite side of the car."
Getting to Dublin from Trim,"Hi - we're using Trim as our home base for our first couple nights in Ireland. We'd like to head into Dublin on a Saturday. We will have a rental car but for obvious reasons don't want to drive into the city.  What would be a convenient place to park and take public transport?  
Many thanks",It should be fine to right into town tbh. You could park on quays. It's week days that are an absolute nightmare. But I drive into town at winds and there's generally little to no traffic.
Need advice on rental car versus buses for Dublin/Galway trip,"Hello all, my husband and I (in our 30s) are planning a trip to Ireland sometime next year (probably September) and I am working on our budget. Originally we were planning to rent a car, but from what I've read in this sub and online, it seems more complex than what I'm used to here in the US (rental insurance fees and all that). I haven't had a chance to dig really deep into various rental agencies' terms and conditions, but it seems like there are significantly more costs than the base daily rates I've found so far. Which I should have expected of course, but things are looking expensive...

I am still going to research more into renting a car, but I was hoping to get some feedback about our (very preliminary) itinerary, should we decide to skip the car and use buses/tours instead.

We are hoping to spend about 10-12 days in Ireland. We would be flying in and out of Dublin Airport and be mainly based in Galway. For the time we are in Dublin, there are a handful of things we'd like to see in the city and nearby. We are especially interested in seeing Newgrange and Wicklow Mountains/Glendalough. I found a few different tour buses that go to those places. After a few days in the Dublin area, we'd take a CityLink bus to Galway and spend several days there. One day would be a Cliffs of Moher/Burren tour day. 

A couple things I'm wondering: Will we miss out on a lot by not having a car? I've already discovered there isn't an easy way to get to the megalithic sites in Sligo via bus (if someone has a clever suggestion about this, I'm all ears!), and we're interested in seeing some more countryside/national parks, castle ruins, etc. We also don't necessarily like the idea of doing too many official bus tours. I think the three I've listed are doable without feeling too rushed or getting too expensive. But then I wonder if it will all come out close to or more expensive than just renting a car? Of course I'll have to try to pin down an estimate for a car (plus gas) as closely as I can, but I welcome any advice about car vs. buses and tour bus trips, specific tour buses/other transport to avoid, and sites we shouldn't miss that are easy to get to from Galway (via bus, train, or car). I need some help thinking outside the box, please. Thank you in advance!","I’ll second the YouTube visit. I watched several hours of videos of different people driving in Ireland so I was visually familiar with the road system and how to navigate them. It’s super helpful, especially on one lane roads. 

Understanding how to handle a situation where another car is approaching you on a one lane road helped me feel comfortable when it happened to me. I didn’t panic or act like a dorky tourist when this happened. Everyone else in the car was like, “what are going to do?!?!”. Lol. I was like, “I got this!”"
Ireland car rental for young driver?,"I’m travelling to Ireland for the second time with my mother in April, and am searching for car rentals. My mom is a very nervous driver, doesn’t like big cities, uncomfortable driving a standard transmission, etc. I am a very experienced driver, I drive trucks for a livestock transport company so I drive trucks with 50 foot trailers at least weekly and all of my vehicles have been standard, I’ve drove in Toronto, Dallas and LA before. For these reasons we’re trying to find a rental company that will allow me to be a driver with our rental car. 

  I’m 20 years old, and have held a full Canadian drivers license for 4 years, and I’ve had no at fault accidents in my driving history. Anyone know a rental company who will rent to an experience 20 year old? I’ve seen so many wanting their drivers to be over 25. Thanks for any help anyone can offer!","Yes that’s what we’re going to do, put the rental under her name and add me as a driver. I can’t find any rental companies that will allow drivers under 25 so far though"
10 Day Itinerary - Would Love Feedback/Advice,"Hello! My husband and I are going to Ireland for the first time next May from May 12 - 22 and would love some feedback and advice on our tentative itinerary. Thanks so much! 

**In general,** we enjoy beer quite a bit and plan on mostly dining in pubs. We plan to get around via train with a Eurail pass and we'll use public transportation within the cities. We're hoping to stay mostly within the cities since we don't mind walking a few miles to our destinations, but in Kilkenny or Killarney we'd probably enjoy a place a little further out with a view. We don't have many activities planned at this time or things we must do so we're open to any suggestions you may have for these cities! 

**Day 1 & 2 - Dublin**

* *We will be flying into Dublin EARLY at 5AM. Any recommendations on things we can do before checking into our AirBnB later that afternoon?*
* We plan on going to museums, pubs, Trinity Library, dinner at Brazen Head one night and the Guinness Storehouse. Day 2 I would like to go explore Howth. 

**Day 3 & 4 - Kilkenny**

* Train to Kilkenny from Dublin.
* Smithwicks, a castle or two 
* We were planning on going Dublin>Killarney>Dingle, but from my research it looks like Dingle isn't super easy to get to via public transport. *Would you recommend Dingle over Kilkenny?* 
* On Day 4 we plan on renting a car in the evening then the morning of Day 5 driving to Killarney > 

**Day 5 & 6 - Killarney** 

* Drive to Killarney from Kilkenny. This is the only portion of the trip we plan on having a car because we want to drive the Ring of Kerry on Day 6. 
* Turn in our rental car the night of Day 6

**Day 7 & 8 - Galway**

* Train to Galway from Killarney the morning of Day 7 
* Public transport from Galway to Doolin on Day 8 to head to one of the pubs in town to find a tour guide a friend highly recommend that will walk us to the Cliffs of Moher. 

**Day 9 & 10 - Dublin**

* We'll take the train back to Dublin from Galway and spend one more night in Dublin before flying out. We might try to head out to Powerscourt Gardens on Day 9 if we have the time. 

Thanks for reading!","I'm a local so of course I feel this way but honestly driving in Ireland is not that bad. If you've already done the Ring of Kerry, driving to Galway will be easy! The drive itself can be lovely as you'll be taking in a good chunk of the Wild Atlantic Way, which is beautiful. You'll miss all that on the train."
Plan for 10 days trip with public transport + some questions,"Hello everyone! My girlfriend and I are planning a 10 days trip to Ireland in August. We have to use public transport because cars unfortunately are way more expensive for that period, and we prefer to save budget for outdoor activities and tours. We both visited Dublin in the past years, so we would like to focus on the rest of the country. We have some questions about our trip, maybe you could help us and give us some good advice. Thanks in advance to everyone who could help! 

PS: If someone is planning a trip to Italy (especially north and center) we could help you in return without problem, just PM me!

Those are our mains questions, below you could find our full plan:

* **QUESTION 1: Do you have any suggestions about must-see places or best hiking to take in the Killarney National Park? We have planned only the bike on boat trip through the lakes to take the famous journey through the Gap of Dunloe.**
* **QUESTION 2: We would like to do a boat tour from Dingle with Sea Safari in the afternoon. It seems very interesting, is it worth the cost?** 
* **QUESTION 3: Is an electric bike a good option to explore Slea Head and surroundings?**
* **QUESTION 4: We could spend only a few hours in Limerick and Ennis, do you have any must see to suggest in those two cities?**
* **QUESTION 5: From Doolin we would like to do some of those activities based on weather conditions and availability: to take the ferry to Aran Islands and rent two bikes for exploring one island  / to go to the Cliff of Moher by foot or bike or bus / to do a sea kayak tour in the area with North Clare Sea Kayaking. Do you have any suggestions or experiences about them?**
* **QUESTION 6: We could spend only a few hours in Galway, do you have any must see to suggest in this city?**
* **QUESTION 7: Is it a good idea to book train and bus tickets in advance for our trip?**

If you have any other suggestions about our plan you are welcome! Thank you again!
